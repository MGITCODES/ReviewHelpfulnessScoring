3338::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::20::::very helpful::::09.12.2001::::    After having a Motorola mobile phone as my first, I decided I wanted something a bit more high-tech. So after saving up my Ciao and Dooyoo earnings, I trundled along to Asda to eye up the different phones available. I had read quite a few opinions about the Nokia 3310 and I was pretty sure this was the right model for me, but I had a word with the assistant first to make sure. I wanted a phone, which had games on it and one where you could download ringtones and logos, as I fancied having a pop song and a cute cat or something. Somehow, I had assumed it would be able to send and receive calls too.I had    130 and the Nokia 3310 was around this price. I thought that the more expensive a phone is, the better it would be, but this is not always the case  I hadn  8217;t intended changing my phone for a year or so, and I wanted something that would last. We don  8217;t always get what we want.The Nokia 3310 looks good though, a nice size   8211; smaller than my Motorola, but not so tiny that you lose it. I wanted a pay-as-you-go phone, not wishing to run up any more bills, thankyou very much. This phone accepts vouchers from the One-to-One network. You get a    3 credit in the box, then you can register for a further    7.Now, I  8217;m not a technical kind of person, so this won  8217;t be a technical kind of opinion. I am also not going to copy out reams of information that you  8217;ll find in the accompanying booklet, you can read that if you buy one. But this is going to be my experiences with this model of phone and yes, surprisingly enough, my opinion The phone is easy to set up and easy to use. I soon got the hang of it, apart from that annoying predictive option on the text messaging facility   8211; you know, the one where you  8217;re trying to write   8216;Are you coming round for a cuppa?  8217; and it ends up sending   8216;Your Uncle  8217;s wombat ate my banana tree  8217; instead. But that can be turned off, I  8217;m not sure how, but my son managed it and he  8217;s only nine.I downloaded a few ringtones too, which was fun   8211; but does work out expensive, so watch out  It  8217;s also best to listen to them on a website first, as The Real Slim Shady was unrecognisable  I ended up with Chain Reaction, which worked well and means it  8217;s easy to tell when it  8217;s your phone ringing.As you would expect, the Nokia 3310 has a Phone Book option to store all your important numbers. You can also write text messages, change the ringtones and volume settings, see if you have missed any calls, a voicemail facility and a whole list of other options   8211; most of which you never seem to need.I found it very helpful to have a clock function, as not wearing a watch, it is difficult to tell the time   8211; you look at your wrist and it  8217;s always two hairs past freckle. I used to resort to carrying a big pink alarm clock in my bag and the phone was a much lighter and less garish option.The calculator was quite useful too, especially when trying to check you haven  8217;t overspent on Christmas shopping. I also used the reminders, having an alarm set to go off to tell me of various appointments and so on.The phone also has four games on it   8211; Space Impact (a kind of Space Invaders meets Galaxian, that I quite liked), Snake, Bantumi and Pairs. Of these three, my kids and my fianc    frequently borrowed my phone to play Snake and Pairs, regularly comparing high scores ad nauseum. It soon got to the stage where the one place you could guarantee the phone WOULDN  8217;T be was with ME  No-one understood Bantumi though.So far, so good   8211; lots of features, nice model, well worth the money, eh? Well, no, not really. You see, the problem was that 80  of the time, you couldn  8217;t hear anyone who rang you. I really need a mobile, so that people can contact me while I  8217;m slaving away on the Internet. But what happened is they  8217;d ring, I  8217;d pick it up and hear   8216;Hi crackle crackle  8217; and have to ring them back on the house phone, kind of defeating the object.It wasn  8217;t just in the house either, wherever I was, it was the same. Even ringing 121, you  8217;d get   8216;Your balance is crackle crackle  8217;. Still, it saved on money, as I could never ring anyone  So I took it back and replaced it. The same thing happened with the second one. So yesterday, I went back to Asda and this time said I wanted to try a completely different model and a different network. I bought a Panasonic mobile phone, using the Vodafone network. I  8217;ll let you know how I get on. It was just under    70 too, so I received    60 back in Asda vouchers and went on a shopping spree. See, it was worth that money after all ;-)     ::::5017453:2:::5186837:4:::5096163:4:::5000287:4:::5018647:4:::5018647:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::16642:4:::5023460:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5085584:4:::5085584:4:::5093497:4:::8689:4:::9081:4:::9081:4:::5019443:4:::5019443:4:::5002698:4:::5096519:4:::5085331:4:::21963:4:::5077810:4:::9435:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::1911:4:::5026664:4:::5026664:4:::6644:4:::6644:4:::6239:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5151805:4:::21638:4:::21638:4:::10901:4:::10901:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::5013036:4:::5013036:4:::5026044:4:::1669:4:::1669:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5092284:4:::5020889:4:::5016866:4:::2998:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::5085330:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::17253:4:::17253:4:::5091877:4:::5091877:4:::5161892:4:::19266:4:::</endperson>

5441040::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::20.03.2005::::    Nokia   that s the name. 3310   that s the number (am i right?).           We are in the age of mobile technology and one needs a phone that is durable, easy to handle, and and simple. If you are interested in these features, then NOKIA 3310 is the answer. It is what we can describe as- basic. It doesn t have all these features you ll see in all these new mobile phones that are comming out now in the market- no camera, no polyphonic ringtones, no colour screen, it s not GPRS wap supported, and ..oh  it s not a flip phone ( am I stupid? everyone knows that). So if you are the type who want any of these features in your phone, sorry then look elsewhere for phone because the 3310 is not made for your type.              But that does not mean it s a good for nothing phone, in fact I ll say it s one of the best phone that has ever been manufactured by any GSM manufacturer because of its durability and its hard as nut make. Then most of the other functions that are in this phone are very useful to make it worth the price it s being sold in the market now.            Let s take a look at some of the options at a glance, then we ll discuss it at length..........   1.... *phone book*   2... *messages*   3... *chat*   4... *call register*   5....*tones*   6....*settings*                                                          ****PHONE BOOK****            I ll call it the starting point of this phone,in fact it is. The manufacturers call it   menu 1  . This is the area where you can store the phone number of anyone and it s related names in your SIM card. Right in this place, there is what the manufacturers call speed dialling.To access this   menu 1  (I think I am liking that name), you ll press the NAVI key(whatever that means?), then press that key again for select. This key is the very first key just below the screen and above the 2 key.           In this phone book menu, there are two   sub menus  , the first submenu shows the search function, which allows you to recall the desired name and phone number from the phone book.(are you beginning to see the added advantage?).          Then the second submenu has the service number functions which let you easily call the service number of your service provider. But the dissadvantage is (oh  not now ) this menu is shown only if there are service numbers stored in your SIM card.                                          ****MESSAGES****              Within this menu, you can use various message functions related to voice, text and picture messages, you can write and send Multi-part text messages, and you can check your incomming messages in there also. These are what the makers call the   inbox   and the   outbox   (stylishly) and you can store your text message in there also in case you are not ready to send it yet. It has a capacity of storing 14 text messages(it would have been nicer if there are more than 14).               This feature allows you to preset message as a basis for your message, add a smiley character to the message (wow ), allow you to select any desired language you want to use and so on and so forth  (they are just too many).                                                                              ****CHAT****          This is what I shall call   glorified text message  (GTM). See it s because it allows you to have a conversation with other people using text mesages. But since I have been using the phone, I have tried several times to use this function but I have not succeded. I mean, none of my supposed   chat mates    have answered me. So GTM, little value, pronto.                                         ****CALL REGISTER****        This is where you can access the phone numbers that are registered automati\cally by the phone. When you receive a call,the phone automatically regsiter the number that has called, so you can access it at a later time. You can also view the approximate duration and cost of your calls, and you can manage the credit units on your SIM card. It a cool place because it help you manage your costs. It s really handy.                                        ****TONES****             Now we arrive at one of the interesting features of this phone...One thing: GET READY TO BLOCK YOUR EARS .This unique phone is reputed to have one of the most annoying and loudest ringing tones, message tones and alert tones among its contemporaries. It has a high pitch tone that makes you know that you have a call whereever you are. Maybe the manufacturers wanted to use the tone as a market value to claim that they have a high respoce to message, I dont know, but what I know is that although the tone is advantageous, I warn you  It can really be annoying.            But apart from this, the tones can be really cool, in this feature, you have the opportunity of choosing from more that thirty something ring tones that are featured. It also has a vibrating alert, and keypad tones.              You can compose a ringing tone of your choice in this feature if you dont like the ones that are manufactured with it. One really fine aspect of this phone is the ability to receive a ringing tone from somebody, and you can also send a ringing tone to other phones, I tell you few phones has this provision. Let s leave it that way.                                       ****SETTINGS****           Within the settings, you can adjust the call settings, the general phone settings, and the security settings.            In the call settings, we have the automatic redial function, the speed dialling function, the call waiting options, the own number settings automatic answer.......( I can t continue). You have these options open wide to your face.            Then come to the phone settings, we have the language, cell information display, welcome note (oh too much).           This phone is equipped with a versatile security system to prevent from unauthorised use of it and your SIM.There you can enable a pin code that you alone know so that anyone wil not just take it and use. there are other security features also but they are not that important. Such as call baring service, phone security, changing of access code, excetera.                         As far as I am  concerned, these features that I have nentioned above are the really important ones to me, the rest are just  added responsibility  to make the phone   full  .  These include games, calculators, reminders, clock, and proiles.                   So these are some of the   beutiful   features of this  unique  phone that is named   nokia3310  .         because of the fact that this phone is one one of the most durable phone, it has gain a really large measure of popularity and (maybe) respect. but it s now so porpular and cheap that almost everyone can have one, it s one of the most popular phone that has existed. In Nigeria alone, more than 20 million people are using this   rugged   phone (that s how they describe it ) to the extent that in their computer megacity located in the heart of Ikeja, it s being advertised as   pure water  . and it s being sold now for 34 pounds.      Nokia 3310 is ok to use, if you are not the   happening   type.        Some other facts about this phone includes: *** Phone size: 10.8 cm in height, 2cm in depth, 4.4cm in width. *** talk duration: 3-5 hours. *** Recharge time: 4-5 hours.  *** standby time: 60-280 hours.          So in summary, although Nokia 3310 is not as sofisticated as some other phone, it is durable, lasts long, reliable and ...IT CAN MAKE NOISE  . :)                                                                                                           ::::6216822:3:::6216822:3:::5096965:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5276833:3:::5276833:3:::5678162:4:::5678162:4:::5430786:4:::5575371:4:::5575371:4:::5649735:4:::5651260:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5615600:4:::5640634:4:::5640634:4:::5478648:4:::5478648:4:::5534605:4:::5534605:4:::5410477:4:::5410477:4:::5186837:4:::5494298:4:::5494298:4:::5606726:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5629559:4:::5541860:4:::5584168:4:::5517731:4:::5618817:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5614035:4:::5614035:4:::</endperson>

5020858::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::18.04.2001::::    The Nokia 3310, whats it about?The 3310 is a quite smart and stylish phone and possible the best Nokia to look at, but is it what every one makes out to be. The answer is maybe, it is a very good looking phone and it has all the added features like the changeable covers and the games but i fear it isnt much different than the others.Okay to start off with it has the good features of the usual Nokia like the easy to use menu bar and of course the game snake. Behond that though their aint much else that makes it differ from the 3210. Yeah it is small and easily held, and it has no arial but you dont get the signal that you get on a phone with an arial.Overall i would say to people to buy it if they feel they want it but there are better phones out there with better features and also a lot cheaper.     ::::6588863:1:::5020891:2:::5020891:2:::9444:2:::9444:2:::</endperson>

5368168::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::30.08.2003::::    In the fast-moving world of mobile phones, the Nokia 3310 would be considered an OAP. Nowadays, mobiles are so much more than phones. Who  8217;d be caught dead a 3310 when the new generation of phones can surf the internet, take photos, film a short moving picture, walk the dog, make the bed, and cook the dinner? ?  Well, me, that  8217;s who.Now, I don  8217;t know about anybody else, but I don  8217;t ask for much from a phone - the ability to make and receive calls, texts, along with somewhere to store numbers is really primary to any built-in cameras, microwaves or lawn mowers I  8217;m not the best at   8220;rolling with the times  8221;, and don  8217;t see the need in changing my mobile every time a newer, smaller, flashier one comes onto the market. Especially as I  8217;ve hardly broken in my new model before something   8216;better  8217; comes along. I  8217;m only on my second phone in about 6 years, and I  8217;m happy with it  Unless it gets lost, stolen, or dies on me, I won  8217;t be changing it. This isn  8217;t defiance, this is because I love the the thing.--- What  8217;s so great about it then?  ---Aha. Simplicity. We  8217;ve done simplicity, in the sense that the 3310 won  8217;t fill your photo album or mow your lawn, but will perform the perfunctory requirements of a standard phone. By jove  Comparisons aside (I promise), the phone is very easy to operate. A main on-off switch is located at the head of handset, and everything you need can be accessed from the main on-screen menu. Display is clear and generally large, with options to modify phonebook layout and screensaver, and even download logos, to suit you and get the look you want.That  8217;s not all. Why are the more popular phones ignoring what was so great about the whole face-off phenomenon?  You get bored of the 3310 all you have to do is rip of it  8217;s cover and fit on a new one  Covers are sold all over the place... although I would recommend looking at discount stores, and outdoor markets first, as you  8217;ll find the    20 covers from the Carphone Warehouse here no problem, for a fraction of the price. My favourite fraction thus far being 25      After paying a fiver for a colourful cover and finding it stratches and scuffs in less than a week, I was glad I  8217;d never forked out that   20. Word of warning.--- What can I do with a 3310?  ---Well, you could fashion it as a door-stop or book-end, but it  8217;s not all that effective. Instead, open the menu and amuse yourself Pretty self-explanatory, Store your names and numbers here for fast access and dialling. Assign specific ringing tones to individual people, and use voice tags to call a friend without pressing a button. Write and receive texts. Inbox holds a maximum of about 10 messages. There are even picture messages and smilies to liven up your texts.Text messaging, but more annoying. I fail to see the point.Check your missed calls list, dialled numbers, received calls, times etc.Modify ringing tones, using the ones available, or compose your own  Mucho fun trying to work out Beethoven s 5th symphony using only 9 keys. Or, download a few, there are empty spaces waiting.The tech centre. Modify things like language (not much fun when you switch everything to Swahili and can  8217;t find your way back to rectify it ), welcome note, speed dialling, security... heaps of stuff. GAMES>Let the fun begin  Here we have:- Snake II : Ah, great during boring lectures, delayed train journeys and the like. - Space Impact : Little rocket thing with lasers and suchlike. Hurts after a while. - Pairs : Unveil the symbols behind the boxes and make a pair. Requirements = Good eyesight. Extreme boredom.- Bantumi : I have only just sussed this game recently. I preferred losing when I didn  8217;t know why.CALCULATOR>Mathematics need never be a problem  Add, subtract, multiply, divide   go  For the forgetful. Very useful, though annoying when you think you have a text message from a gorgeous prospective partner and turns out you need to do the laundry at 3pm. Set date and time, and you  8217;re away. I always use my phone as a watch, so this is a must. Also features alarm feature and stopwatch, incase you  8217;re cooking eggs... or something.Personalise your tones and settings so the phone works at different volumes, vibrations, ringtones, etc, according to profile.You see, what more do you want?  I love this phone. It meets all my needs, it  8217;s the perfect size, can be modified to suit your personality with tones and covers, it  8217;s still sexy and smart and extremely easy to use and maintain. Long live the Nokia 3310 The great thing about phones and fashion trends is that the oldies are now fantastically affordable. I got the Nokia 3310 for    100 back in 2000, but now you  8217;ll have change out of    80. Shop around and see if you can still find the little beauty. The Carphone Warehouse still stocks the handset, and you can get in on any of the major networks Pay As You Go, or monthly contracts. Well worth it, I guarantee you won t be disappointed.     ::::5507218:3:::5532420:3:::5472775:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5487087:4:::5487087:4:::5645088:4:::5588010:4:::5588010:4:::5478025:4:::5630242:4:::5601909:4:::5552490:4:::5552490:4:::5475994:4:::5475994:4:::5545990:4:::5545990:4:::5431846:4:::5258003:4:::5258003:4:::5065876:4:::5065876:4:::5487912:4:::5570309:4:::5570309:4:::5568819:4:::5255275:4:::5255275:4:::5379908:4:::5379908:4:::5410477:4:::5410477:4:::5521013:4:::5521013:4:::5093015:4:::5253113:4:::5487381:4:::5487381:4:::5481960:4:::5389575:4:::5389575:4:::5502918:4:::5502918:4:::5326802:4:::5333903:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5366658:4:::5366658:4:::5469307:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5373984:4:::5353170:4:::5285498:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5353131:4:::5353131:4:::5403217:4:::5403217:4:::5383625:4:::5387363:4:::5331903:4:::5334526:4:::5334526:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5080956:4:::5041033:4:::5041033:4:::5340239:4:::5080352:4:::5311794:4:::5311794:4:::5203401:4:::5203401:4:::5371793:4:::5521790:5:::5473505:5:::</endperson>

5331236::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::28.04.2003::::    I ve had this phone for two years, and i have had no complaints whatsoever   The phone is functional and can do the usual things including the addictive Snake2 and Space Impact   Still haven t worked out how to play Bantumi mind   The battery life is good and the quality of calls are excellent.  My only gripe is it cost me a fortune, back in the day.You can pick these up cheaply second hand and they make a great spare or second phone, even better to give the kids so they can ring you for a lift home at night   Apparently you can also get alsorts of daft things like flashing keypads and dual sim card holders and snazzy snap on covers   I ve got a christmas hat for it, it light up everytime the phone rang   Fantastic.     ::::5066178:2:::5066178:2:::5274315:2:::5309048:2:::5261058:2:::5332164:2:::</endperson>

15103::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::21.02.2001::::    I wrote an opinion a couple of days ago about my Motorola phone and wishing I had a Nokia phone.  Well, I ve bought one   I purchased the Nokia 3310 over the Internet and got a better deal than I would have got in the High Street, saving    20.  I d heard many reports about this phone, all good, but to experience just how good it is for myself was a thrill.The phone came yesterday and I soon set about trying to work out how to send messages, call people etc. etc.  I am however stuck on one basic thing   That is: it seems to be set up for predictive text messaging and I don t want to use that right now, but I don t know how to get out of it.  I know (I think) that you access  Dictionary  but I don t know how to cancel the predictive text messaging from there.  It s a bit of a pain because at the moment I can t send any messages to try it out, as I get fed up cancelling the letters that appear when it thinks I want a certain word   Any ideas?  Apart from that hiccup, it s a great little phone, good to look at, with a vast array of features.  The screensaver facility is a neat little idea, and I ve already chosen mine.  There are lots of different ringtones to choose from, and although I have set one up, I will be changing it for a Backstreet Boys tune (crazy about them as I am )  There are 4 games on the Nokia 3310 and I have had a few games today of Space Impact, which is a version of the old Space Invaders.  I didn t get too bad a score the first time and won a trophy, which turned around and came with a congratulatory tune  You can also set the time up on the phone, which is handy, use the alarm or reminder facility, calculator and many many more things.  You are able too, to choose a welcome message and although I know that a lot of phones have this, (my daughter s Bosch phone will do this) my Motorola never did, so it s all a novelty to me.  There is also a  chat  facility although I m not sure how that works yet.If I was to have one gripe about the Nokia 3310, it would be that the button on the top of the phone is not too easy to press to turn the phone on, so I end up having to dig my nail in a bit, but there are so many good points to the phone, that this goes by the by.Well done Nokia      ::::5012426:3:::5001532:3:::</endperson>

5364984::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::19.07.2003::::    I aquired my Nokia 3310 about 3 months ago, I use the word aquire since it is a work phone so I did not actually buy it.During this time it has never let me down. I find it very to use, even for a bit a mobile novice like myself and  measuring just 113mm x 48mm x 22mm it is incredibly compact.  It weighs just 133g and I find that I can put it in my pocket and forget that its there.I know that it is not the latest most up to date creature but it is perfect for my everyday needs.It comes with a standard grey cover but has interchangeable front and back covers available in yellow, green, red and blue, these are available for around    3 each at most stockists.It comes with all of the features I require, a calculator, alarm clock and Internet connection as well as voice activated dialling and vibration alert, although some features like  the thermoter and business cards I have hardly used.There are 35 preset ringer tones with the option of setting a further 7 of your own and a nice feature is the ability to assign specific ringtones to your stored numbers.My 3310 came with 4 different games, if only I could find the time to figure them out This phone comes with 4 hours 30 mins talktime which is quite impressive as well as 10 days standby. The only notable downside I can think of is the speed at which the Inbox can fill up if you don t regularly delete your messages, the inbox only holds 20 messages which is less than many other phones.Before my nokia 3310 I guess I thought that having a mobile was not such a crucial thing but now have changed my mind and to be honest I would feel lost without it.I would recommend a Nokia 3310 to anyone.     ::::5302103:2:::5257223:2:::5001428:2:::5001428:2:::5321398:2:::4665:2:::6601486:3:::5352779:3:::5352779:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5217434:3:::5284267:3:::5284267:3:::5126903:3:::5297072:3:::5349970:3:::5186837:3:::5320274:3:::5364717:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5217069:3:::5217069:3:::5328942:3:::5248571:3:::5248571:3:::5251448:3:::5346580:3:::5346580:3:::5345869:3:::5345869:3:::5809166:4:::5804336:4:::5326898:4:::</endperson>

20917::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::20.03.2003::::    Opinion 4,593 on the Nokia 3310I really, really HATE cell-phones. I should qualify that statement. I hate the way they get used, from the one-handed driver (who always seems to be behind me when I have to brake hard) to being on a bus at 4 p.m. surrounded by a total shower of secondary school kids    effing and blinding    into an amazing array of up-to-the-minute technology.However, when it comes to    fess up    time, I have to say that I   ve got one, and have done for years. I think I must have been the person they invented pay-as-you-go for, though. I can put    10 credit onto mine and make it last nearly all bloody year.The secret? I only use it to warn people when something UNscheduled is about to happen,    hallo, I   m NOT on the train    being a prime example.I hardly ever turn mine on, unless I   ve prearranged to do so with someone who needs to contact me whilst I   m out, so my recorded announcement carries a warning that writing me a letter would be a quicker means of getting hold of me So what   s this got to do with the Nokia 3310, one of the most written-about phones on any opinion site? I   ve got one, that   s what, and since I   ve had it for a while, and intend to do so until it fails, I regard myself as good a person as any to give a long term impression of the damned thing.HOW DID I COME BY IT?A couple of years ago, BT Cellnet as it was, then decided that in order to stop me straying to the    dark side    of pay-as-you-go, they needed to pull a rabbit out of the hat, in the form of a really good tariff. My deal was to give me 15-months rental, including 100 minutes use per month, all for an up-front payment of    89, so I jumped on the deal.However, smelling a rat, I mentioned that my existing phone, an aging Ericsson, could well fail me in the battery department during that prolonged period.    No worries, Mr. Green, we   ll send you a new phone now    came the reply, and that   s how I came by the Nokia 3310. I stuck with this for 15 months, before O2, Cellnet   s second coming, offered me a    really good deal    -    89 for 12 months with less minutes per month. At this point, I dove for the    dark side   , taking the phone, which apparently I now owned, with me.APPEARANCETo my way of thinking, the current trend to make phones smaller and smaller is missing one vital point, the size of the human face. The Nokia, a phone not exactly in its first flush of youth, seems to me, to be just about the right size, being genuinely pocket-able but having some substance to it. The much-vaunted interchangeable facia facility is of no great interest to me, although I did swap-out the original two-tone grey for an official Nokia replacement in metallic maroon, but that   s as far as I go with that. Cover removal has a knack to it, and anyone proud of their finger nails had better get someone else to do it.In its maroon guise, my original white rubber buttons are now replaced by silver ones with pale green back lighting. This I find strangely unhelpful in daylight conditions, as it seems to blend in with the silver, making text messaging a very hit and miss affair. I   m looking at it now, and the letters are MUCH clearer with the phone turned off Shape-wise, the Nokia is quite bland and inoffensive, being all smooth curves. The display is an adequate size to show several lines of text.The one thing I miss most, when compared to my old Ericsson, is a pen-clip to secure it when in a top pocket. There IS one on the leather case, but I find these quite tacky and they bulk-up the phone to the extent that they just don   t seem so dainty afterwards.FEATURESWhen introduced, this was probably described as having more features than you can    shake a stick at   . (Someone ought to tell the people who invent these phrases, that prepositions are not the kind of words to end a sentence WITH ).Nowadays, that stick must be looking a bit tattered. However, the features it does have remain genuinely useful.a) SEX AIDS - The vibrating call alert is always good for a laugh, especially if you   ve forgotten that the phone is on        how was it for you    sent as a text message starts to take on a whole new meaning if the thing is in a pocket in the vicinity of de ol    weddin    tackle. Left on a glass-topped table, (the phone, not my wedding tackle*) the din is quite alarming, and makes the Nokia prone to lemming impressions as it dives for the floor. *The din is also quite alarming when I put the said personal items on a glass-topped table, especially if it hasn   t been warmed up in advance.b) THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE - Voice actuation is quite useful, if you can be arsed to set it up. This works in tandem with your existing Phone Book of remembered numbers. Having selected the number in question, say, your home number, you can teach the phone to react to the words    Phone home    or similar. One hint here     don   t put on your best telephone manner for the recording session, otherwise your exhortations to    fonome     won   t be recognised. Just be yourself and it works - most of the time. As a feature, I hardly ever bother to use it, but I can see that anyone taking a responsible attitude to cell-phone use in the car might want it, since you only have to select the number needed and hold down the call button for longer to activate it. This minimises any distraction and dangerous attempts to dial out whilst driving.c) PREDICTIVE TEXT FOR LESS THUMB-ACHE     No, not Old Moore   s Almanac or the works of Nostradamus, but a useful feature to help with the speedier typing of text messages. Each button on a phone keypad has to perform several functions, one of which is obviously to output the tone corresponding to the assigned number. Most keys also carry three letters of the alphabet. Prior to predictive texting, to type, for example, the letter F, you would have had to press the 3\DEF key three times in rapid succession to get F. No real problem there, but suppose the next letter in the typed sequence was to be E, you   d have to wait till the cursor stopped flashing before pressing the same button all over again (twice this time) to get E.With predictive text, typing a word like DEED would be somewhat quicker. You merely press the DEF button 4 times, and as soon as you introduce a space to show that the word is finished, predictive text takes its best guess at what you meant. If the word DEED is not recognised, or maybe the mechanism thought you meant FEED, you can add this word to a personal dictionary of the words you are most likely to want.It takes a bit of getting used to, and during the    learning phase   , it can actually slow you down, but the effort pays off.AFTERTHOUGHTSThere are of course, many other features, but since all cell-phones have them, more a facet of the network than the phone, there   s little mileage in discussing them here.The Nokia 3310 has now become the    free option    on many sign-up packages, which no doubt means they   ve stopped making it, but this needn   t stop you getting one. When it comes to accessories and spares, the Nokia is probably the most catered-for phones around thanks to the fact that more recent Nokia   s like the 3330 tend to use the same parts.I   ve always found battery life to be exemplary. Bearing in mind that I don   t even turn it on, the official figures for standby/conversation time mean little to me. What is impressive is that I can leave it neglected in my coat pocket for a month or so, and still make a call on it when I want to If you just want a cheap (possibly even free) phone, and don   t care about it being the world   s smallest or most feature-packed then the 3310 does it, and does it well.AND it bounces      ::::5327467:2:::5327467:2:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5241792:4:::5318774:4:::5323560:4:::5202792:4:::5308285:4:::5319538:4:::5026776:4:::5246899:4:::5217259:4:::5217069:4:::5217069:4:::6389:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5312828:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5291620:4:::5291620:4:::5085331:4:::5316894:4:::5126903:4:::5288452:4:::5116798:4:::5308666:4:::16949:4:::16949:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5283721:4:::5311794:4:::5311794:4:::5269811:4:::5269811:4:::5025486:4:::5025486:4:::5310553:4:::5240143:4:::5240143:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::6644:4:::6644:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5310012:4:::5310012:4:::5280498:4:::5280498:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::5247058:4:::5240190:4:::5066613:4:::5066613:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::</endperson>

5258003::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::26.02.2005::::    From the moment it hit the shelves the Nokia 3310 was destined to be a classic. Basically there had never been a phone that looked so classy, and even today it s instantly recognisable. Now while I ve changed my phone and moved on to smarter, more fashionable and advanced models, my husband has stuck with his, for the simple reason that it does exactly what he wants from a phone (makes and receives calls), is simple to use and very, very durable.~~~The looks~~~The 3310 is a classic, when it was brought out it was quite simply the smallest mobile you could buy, measuring 113mm x 48mm x 22mm it fits snugly in the hand, the biggest invention however was that this phone did not have an external aerial, which added to it s sleek look. Out of the box, the Nokia comes with a silver Xpress on cover, but you won t see many with the original cover due to the fact that you can buy a multitude of replacements at often very cheap prices.~~~Charging the battery~~~The battery takes quite a long time to charge, recommended time for the first charge is 16 hours, with subsequent charges taking anything upto 3 hours (or more depending on the age of the battery). However, battery life is fantastic, even after 2 years my husbands phone only needs charging every three days with reasonably heavy usage.~~~The screen~~~The screen is nothing fantastic, basically a black and white display with a greenish backlight. but perfectly upto the job. One problem we ve had is that the screen is actually the one part of the 3310 to break if its dropped, but can be replaced relatively cheaply (I paid    15 for a replacement screen on a market stall).~~~Adding Contacts~~~Adding contacts to this phone is remarkable easy, in common with later Nokias the address book is simple to navigate and it s a simple case of navigating to the add contact, and inputting the name and number. You can only add one number per name, however, so we ended up with double entries for some people, which is easy to get round by adding home or mobile after the name.~~~Making Calls~~~This is the reason that my husband loves this phone so much, it is so simple to make and receive calls. You can either input the number that you want to call and press the green start call button, find the number through your contacts, or use the list of previously dialled numbers.Once the call is started, reception is crystal clear in most areas (depending on network) and the volume can be adjusted to a suitable level.~~~Texting~~~As well as being simple to make calls with, it is exceptionally easy to send texts with this phone. The keypad is very well laid out and it is easy to press the buttons. Personally I find the dictionary annoying, and write texts using keypresses, but must admit that the dictionary does work extremely well. This was the first phone I owned that actually used both lower and upper case characters and I find this makes my texts look much neater, no more shouting for me. There are also a number of smileys available along with some templates. ~~~The ringtones~~~The phone comes with a number of mono ringtones, including that annoying    Haribo    one. But you can get ringtones sent to your phone at a reasonable cost (I pay 12p each from free-ringtones-free-logos), or you can compose your own. I find the ringtones are loud and on the most part sound pretty good. Of course you can turn the vibrate function on and the ringtones off if you re somewhere where you need the phone to be a little more discrete. ~~~Games~~~The 3310 comes with four games, for whiling away those hours waiting at bus stops. My personal favourite is Snake, and I must admit that I almost completed it once, but I ve lost my high score. My husband prefers the Space Impact game, which is a scrolling shoot-them-up. For the more academically minded there are pairs and Bantumi ( a very annoying traditional board game). Basically, the games are a nice little extra, and add a little extra value to the phone, but are not as fancy as games on newer phones.~~~Extras~~~As with most phones you get a few extra features on the 3310, such as a reminder, stopwatch, calendar, calculator and alarm clock. Which you will probably find you only use very occasionally.~~~Durability~~~The 3310 is remarkably durable, my husbands is over two years old and has been dropped countless times. The worst that has happens is the cover has flown off, which is easily replaced. The screen, however, is a little less hardy than the rest of the phone, and mine did break after being thrown across the room by my son.~~~Accessories~~~This is what made the 3310 really special, in my opinion. You can get a vast number of accessories for it, from covers featuring all kinds of pictures (mine had Spike from Buffy), costing as little as    5, to flashing keypads and handsfree sets.Due to the phones popularity, you can buy accessories on most markets at very reasonable prices.~~~Price and Availability~~~A quick look online tells me that the 3310 is available from as little as    55.89 SIM free (which means that you can use it on any network) at directmobileaccessories.co.uk or on Ebay with bidding starting at    18.53 brand new.~~~Final Words~~~The 3310 does exactly what a basic mobile phone should, that is allows you to make calls and send texts with ease. It is an ideal phone for someone who is not looking for fancy features such as a colour screen, WAP or a camera. It is therefore ideal for someone like my husband that does not get on well with new technology, as well as the younger teenager who may need something just for piece of mind.In a day and age when children are being mugged for their mobile phones, a 3310 is an ideal solution, after its not exactly the most expensive or technologically advanced phone, so I couldn t imagine a mugger particularly wanting it. And if it did get stolen, it s not like it would cost the earth to replace.     ::::5604910:3:::5697497:4:::5697497:4:::5690774:4:::5628480:4:::5248572:4:::5248572:4:::5515607:4:::5627049:4:::5627049:4:::5622864:4:::5242671:4:::5085508:4:::5085508:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::5020702:4:::5445609:4:::5445609:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5247505:4:::5247505:4:::5020884:4:::5020884:4:::5545847:4:::5255134:4:::5607598:4:::5620203:4:::5616358:4:::5362774:4:::5373212:4:::5373212:4:::5245223:4:::5458382:4:::5458382:4:::1692:4:::1692:4:::5552398:4:::5552398:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5022091:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5503807:4:::5370096:4:::5584168:4:::5499723:4:::5332498:4:::5326039:4:::5552134:4:::5615340:4:::5615340:4:::5517731:4:::5504076:4:::5504076:4:::5217966:4:::5217966:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::</endperson>

5078622::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::08.12.2001::::    It seems that everyone has to keep upto date with the latest mobile phone and to tell you the truth I do not see the point as long as I have a phone which works and is understandable and easy to navigate.As I work in the mobile industry and have done for nearly a year now I have been kept upto date with the latest handsets and been able to test them out. This is generally so that when customers call you are able to help with their enquiries to do with the phone.So as I have been able to do this I have been using Ericson, Motorola, Samsung, Sony and Nokia. Out of all the manufacturers I have found Nokia to be the easiest to use and understand.However everyone seems to be wanting to keep up with the latest model of mobile phone, whoever it is made by and I do not understand why.Recently I had to replace my mobile phone due to it being in-repairable. I had a nokia 3210 and I was still happy with that model of phone to this day and would of kept on using it. As they are not made anymore Nokia were unable to repair it for me as I did have it for 18 months. They told me my best bet was to get a new phone. So anyway I went out looking and shopped around I generally wanted to avoid all other manufacturers apart from Nokia, as nokia I find the easiest to use and as I am used to a nokia I thought I would stick with it.The cheapest around at this time was the 3310. Which is the oldest model of nokia out. It is exactky the same as the 3330, only the 3330 has a wao facility built into it.I decided to buy it for    99 from the carphone warehouse and I got all the relevant accessories with it. I got it home and took it out of the box and what s the first thing when you get anything new you start playing with it and testing it. The menu was very similar to that of the 3210 so I did not need to read the manual and it also helps that I  work in mobile industry as you get to practice using mobile phones. The 3310 is exactly the same as the 3330 but without WAP and I didn t see the point of having WAP for an extra    50 as I have access to the internet via my pc at home to check my e-mails and do stuff on the net. However it maybe is ideal having WAP if you do not have access to this facility elsewhere.The 3310 is reasonable in size,not too big, not too small, the meun is easy to use and follow, if you are interested in changing covers then you can do easily, the phone is just perfect and with nokia   s you are able to download ringtones and logo   s if you want to,although I am not that interested in this feature.So my preference to a model of a mobile phone at the moment is the Nokia 3310 as it is does everything that I feel a phone needs to.One feature I do like about the nokia mobile phones is that you can reply to text messages so you do not have to type in the number all the time like you do on certainly the Motorola and the Sony handsets.Featuresphone book which holds 200 names and numbers, messages for sending text and pictures, chat which is basically sending text messages again, call register where you can check the last 10 calls made and received and duration of your calls,tones which is self explanatory, settings such as security, language, with holding your number, games which is self explanatory, calculator, reminders, this is very helpful if you are forgetful as you can set an alarm to remind yourself of things to do, clock which sets the date and time and has an alarm and profiles which means you can set the phone to different levels of ringing and name them slient, personal, discreet, loud.     ::::5092284:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::19093:3:::19093:3:::9435:3:::20081:3:::6389:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202751:4:::5202751:4:::5202843:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::10438:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::14200:4:::5077810:4:::5035866:4:::</endperson>

5013640::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::10.07.2001::::    Well, I know you are all probably sick and tired of hearing and reading about mobile phones now, so just to annoy you even more, I m going to write an op of my own about the Nokia 3310.This seems to be one of the most popular phones around at the moment, and the opinions which have already been written about it, I can understand why   It is a cool little phone, and very easy to use   I m not one for understanding the latest gadgets on the market, so I was mildly surprised when I soon picked up the uses on this phone As this is the first Nokia phone I have ever owned, I can t compare it to others, so can only tell you about this one There is a phone book, which can store 100 names and numbers.  You can search, add number, erase, edit, assign tone, send a birthday card, options and speed dials.With messages, you can write messages up to 459 characters long.  You can store up to 15 messages, send picture messages and smileys.  The pictures already in the phone are the same as the screensavers.  Under messages, there is a write messages, inbox, outbox, picture messages, templates, smileys, message settings infor service, voice mailbox number and service command editor.You can chat with other Nokia owners through text messaging with someone else.Under Call register is missed calls, received calls, dialled numbers, erase recent call lists, show call duration, show call costs, call cost settings and prepaid credit. Under tones you will find the ringing tone, ringing volume, incoming call alert, composer, message alert tone, keypad tones, warning tones, vibrating alert and screensaver.  There are 35 different ringing tones, and 14 different screensavers.  But, you can also get your own ringing tones and pictures on your phone.There are 4 different games on the phone.  These are Snakes 2, Space Impact, Bantumi, and Pairs 2.Under Settings there is the call settings, phone settings, security settins and restore factory settings.You can also divert your calls, which is handy.  The headings under this is divert all voice calls without ringing, divert when busy, divert if not answered, divert when phone off or no coverage and cancel all diverts.A calculator is in the phone as well. You can set reminders, such as birthdays etc.  A clock is also in the phone, which you can have hidden or shown.For a little thing, it s surprising how much it does   I m so glad I invested in one of these.  And to think I once said I would NEVER own a mobile phone   Now, I won t leave the house without it      ::::5003533:3:::5066672:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5091379:4:::5091379:4:::5091767:4:::5085681:4:::5085681:4:::5090867:4:::5085331:4:::7813:4:::7813:4:::19296:4:::1704:4:::5890:4:::5040619:4:::5000594:4:::5000594:4:::16546:4:::16546:4:::5066470:4:::5035771:4:::5002536:4:::15574:4:::15574:4:::6644:4:::6644:4:::17410:4:::17410:4:::4881:4:::5020168:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::23074:4:::5027357:4:::19266:4:::5025674:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5013036:4:::5013036:4:::5003075:4:::5003075:4:::</endperson>

5386319::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::22.09.2003::::    I like the Nokia 3310. I have had mine now for around 3 or 4 years. I noticed that some people s reviews have mentioned that everyone has one of these mobiles, I personally only know one other person who has a 3310 or a nokia in fact. The good thing about the Nokia 3310 is that it doesn t matter if lots of other people have one anyway because you can personalise them and make them completely individual, all you have to do is go out and by a fascia. These come in all different styles and although they can be quite pricey sometimes it s much cheaper than buying another phone Another good thing about the 3310 is that it has games - something that comes in very handy when your bored  There may not be a huge selection of games to come from but I wouldn t want that anyway, 3 or 4 are fine with me.The phone is easy to use, you don t need to be a brain surgeon to send a text message. Although, like any mobile phone, it takes a little time to get used to.It has lots of ring tones to choose from and of course now you can buy more if you want something a bit different (normally around    1 each).As someone has mentioned it doesn t have any WAP features but that personally doesn t bother me.My only criticism of this phone is that it is slightly heavy from some of the newer phones but the size and weight has never worried me. Also, recently the battery seems to run out very fast but this is probably due to the age of it and as long as I remember to recharge it every other day it s fine.It s not the cheapest of mobile phones but is certainly a lot cheaper than it was a few years ago. It used to be around    110 but is now a much more affordable    69-   75 (obviously depending on where you buy it).Overall the Nokia 3310 is a stylish, easy to use, individual, reliable (yes, individual) mobile phone that can easily be transformed from one day to the next. And most importantly it does what it s supposed to do.     ::::5309048:2:::5244368:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5366673:3:::5277178:3:::5320274:3:::5337786:3:::5387003:3:::5126903:4:::5288452:4:::</endperson>

5015764::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::25.03.2001::::    I just purchased the nokia 3310 mobile phone and felt I had to write an opinion on it.  Basically it  8217;s the best phone I  8217;ve ever come across.  I bought it from the carphone warehouse, well I say bought but I actually got it for free with free connection to BT Cellnet as well (BARGAIN  )  Here  8217;s a brief rundown on the facilities that the 3310 has;1- Phone book, which is able to store 150 names and numbers, you can also apply a voice tag (you speak into the phone and it automatically dials the number ) and assign a ring tone to different numbers.2- Messages, this is my favourite; it has a built in dictionary so as you write your text message it will predict the words for you   8211; very handy  You can also send picture messages and add your own smiley :)                    3- Chat, this service allows you to have a continuous text message conversation with one person.                    4- Call register, this is standard on Nokias and lets you view the numbers you  8217;ve dialled, received and missed among other things.                    5- Tones, the nokia 3310 allows you to download your own tones (up to 5) either off the internet or by ringing one of those numbers in the national press (I  8217;ve currently got Hear  8217;says song on mine ) You can also compose your own unique ring tone. Oh also on this section you can choose to have a screen saver on your phone and also whether to allow it to vibrate or not- useful for meetings or busy trains.                    6- Settings, which are again standard on a nokia and allow you to set up the phone to your requirements i.e.; auto redial and call waiting.                    7- A call divert option.                     8- Games, with this phone you get 4 games, Snake 2, pairs2, space impact and bantumi you can also play these games on the nokia website my current favourite is Bantumi.                    9- Calculator.                      10- Reminders, this is fab I  8217;m always forgetting stuff but this phone allows me to set an alarm with details of things that I need to remember excellent 11- Clock, which has a date function as well.12- Profiles are up to you to set you can have the phone on discreet for example for meetings etc.So anyway I think that  8217;s enough detail. The phone has an excellent battery power, which for me is on average 3 days.  You can also change the back and front of the phone, I  8217;ve currently got Eore on mine (child at heart ) and a wide range of accessories are available.The phone is free at the minute in the carphone warehouse on any contract and expect to pay about    99 for pay as you go.  Also get insured cause they claim these babies cost about    270 to replace   8211; ouch      ::::5311781:2:::5309724:3:::5020426:3:::5020426:3:::5021034:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5331903:4:::5246451:4:::5246451:4:::5217827:4:::10438:4:::5018062:4:::5000287:4:::5023000:4:::5016628:4:::14626:4:::9435:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5018360:4:::5002576:4:::10201:4:::5016911:4:::5002380:4:::5000696:4:::5016845:4:::7733:4:::5012426:4:::5020606:4:::5019887:4:::5016884:4:::5020875:4:::5020875:4:::</endperson>

5085331::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::15.08.2001::::    I have had quite a few mobile phone s now. The one that I have at the moment is the nokia 3310. I have had it for nearly a year now as my husband bought it for me last Christmas.The phone is slim, so you can fit it in to your handbag or your pockets. It s very light too compared to a lot of mobiles. It s a silver phone, and looks very nice and stylish.On the display screen, there is the reception and the battery life. You can also have the time too, which is in the right hand corner.In the phonebook, you can store up to 90 people s name and number. All the names are in alphabetical order, which makes it easier to find who you are looking for.When someone calls you, it shows you there name, so you know who is calling.There is voicemail for when you can not get to your phone. You can have the message that is already on your phone, or you can do your own. I have kept the message that is already on the phone. You know if someone has left you a message, as you get a symbol on the screen of your mobile.You can send text messages, which mobiles can anyway. You can send up to 459 characters in each message, so you can say quite a lot in one message. There is predictive text, which predicts what you are going to write. It does not always get it right though. YOu can send pictures in your messages too but only to people that can receive them. You can store up to 10 messages on your phone at a time. Also in the message part of the phone there is smiley faces too which you can also add.There is call register. This shows you, the last 10 people that phoned you, the last 10 people that phoned buy you missed the phone and the last 10 people that you have phoned.There are 35 tones to choose from. You can also download tones as well. You can download 7 tones of your choice. So all in all you can have up to 42 tones, which is quite a lot. You can send and receive tones from people.There are 4 different games to play. These are:-snake II which is to make the snake bigger by taking it to the foodSpace Impact which is using weapons to survive attacksBantumi which is dropping beans in to a potPairs II which is the same as snapThere is a calculator which to be honest I have never used.There is a reminder section too, where you can add things like birthdays so that you do not forget them. Once the day of the reminder comes up it will beep at you.There is voice dialling. This is calling a name and the phone rings that person up. This is easier than finding the person you are looking for.If you get fed up with the colour of your mobile, you can buy x-press on covers. There are loads of different ones to choose from.The phone has 4 and half hours talk time and 5 and hlaf hours standby time. You will know when you need to charge your phone up as it says low battery on the screen of your mobile and starts beeping too.There is vibration alert too, so if you do not have your tones on, you can have it vibrate instead. This is a good idea if you are somewhere and you do not want your mobile to go off.You can lock your keys, so that you do not accidently ring someone.I got this phone from The Link phoneshop. It cost    129.99, but I have seen it for    99.99 now though. You can buy it from any phone shop, index and argos. YOu can get it on any network too. I have it on the orange network.I d definitely recommend this phone to anyone as it is worth every penny.     ::::5013640:3:::5013640:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5027591:3:::5046089:3:::5079163:3:::5045874:3:::10438:3:::19093:3:::19093:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202843:4:::5096783:4:::5085666:4:::5085666:4:::5027469:4:::5101942:4:::5096954:4:::5066395:4:::5066395:4:::5101925:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::1763:4:::1862:4:::5101981:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5016911:4:::5093256:4:::5096295:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::5077810:4:::5102034:4:::5091531:4:::5092652:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5085480:4:::5085480:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5013036:4:::5013036:4:::5027058:4:::10361:4:::14110:4:::14110:4:::23074:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::5066721:4:::</endperson>

14475::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::04.12.2000::::    Stand aside, Eriksson; Stand aside other competitors. The new phone has arrived, and you ain t got a hope. This phone is amazing and has great features including great new games, chat, good ring tones, screen saver, vibration, and more space for phonebook storage. It is, at the moment    139.99, expensive for a phone but cheap for what you get... it is a brilliant phone. The vibration is very good and the games are all new. The only drawback with one of the games is, although it is a very good game, it is easily to complete and only takes a couple of tries. The other games, apart from snake II with its various mazes have not impressed me much and remind me of such games as logic and memory. It is smaller than the nokia 5110 but larger than the  too small to handle  8110. So its not only all of the above but its compact too      ::::5309724:1:::9444:2:::9444:2:::10539:3:::17253:3:::17253:3:::</endperson>

5035866::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::15.06.2001::::    The Nokia 3310, has to be the best phone around today.I had to purchase a new mobile with the final demise of my Ericsson T10s, which just kept on going off by itself, probably because of all the battering it has taken over these last three years.When I first go the 3310 I was really quite confused with the all the options available and used it for over a month just to make and receive calls.It was then that I really started to look at all the features this phone gives to its users and since then I have been using it almost to its fullest capabilities.Lightweight at only 166gms and small in size means you can slip it in anywhere.You can also change the skin (appearance) in the front and back and this is a great feature especially for showing off a bit.The functions and features are endless and I  8217;ve tried my best to list as many of them.Phonebook ==With  Search, Add, Erase, Edit, Assign tone, Send b  8217;card, Options, Speed dials, Voice tags. Assign tone allows you to specify a specific ring tone for each person in your phone book. Send b  8217;card lets you send people  8217;s names / numbers to other people with the same sort of phone. Speed dials set up the 2-9 keys with numbers that you can call just by holding down that key. Voice tags are where you configure your voice dialing. Options just have how you want your numbers displayed, and it tells you how many spaces you  8217;ve used. Messages =Obviously for SMS (Short Message Service), which is actually not that short this time, The Nokia 3310 allows your text messages to be 459 characters long, instead of the usual 160 characters. It works by breaking the text messages down upto three parts if you send to a phone that can  8217;t cope with it. Inputting the text is extremely easy as you only have to press each button once (instead of three or four times as in previous phones) to get a letter.You have the usual Inbox, Outbox, write and Picture Messages (upto 14). It has some   8216;smileys  8217; that you can edit and insert into any text and some templates, such as   8216;Ring me at home  8217; and some other similar ones.Chat ===This is a new feature on the Nokia s and I feel that it is great. It is like being in a chat room with all of the previous messages displayed on the screen. It may cost the same as a normal SMS but it is very efficient and me and my friends think it is a useful thing to have on your phone. This will work with others who have the same phone or more advanced Nokia models.Call Register =========This is the same as all phones with information such as;  dialed numbers, received calls, missed calls things like that. Tones =====You can change your ring tone, change the volume, change the text message ring, compose your own tunes and set a vibrating alert  You can also specify a screen saver and can download your favourite one from the net and install it into the phone.You can save 7 new tones on the 3310. Settings ======As always, allows you to change the settings on your phone, phone, call, and security settings are the three subtitles, and if you break it you can always restore the defaults. A hint   8211; with the 3310s the   8216;Put my language back to English code  8217; is Menu-6212, a useful thing to know if you get idiots messing with your phone. Games =====Snake II, Pairs II, Bantumi and Space Impact.  A feature I like is that you can turn the sound off and have all impacts etc set to vibrate  Calculator ========It  8217;s a calculator with standard / * - + operations  8230;  Reminders ==This is like a little note book, you set an alarm for the time and a little message comes up saying for instance  8221;you  8217;ve got a meeting at so and so time  8221;. Basically it reminds you  Clock ====Change the date / time, set an alarm clock, also has countdown and stopwatch features. Profiles ======Has the profiles for the phone; you can change all of them apart from   8216;General  8217; to have a specific ring tone, volume, and text message noise, screen saver and whether or not it vibrates. You can create your own profiles so it is set to your style because it is your phone. Well I think that covers most of the features.A far cry from my Ericsson T10s but with this day and age, I  8217;ll probably be writing another opinion, about an ever more advanced phone, at the end of the year.     ::::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5045874:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::5001532:4:::5040568:4:::9435:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5025695:4:::5025695:4:::19093:4:::19093:4:::20081:4:::5020889:4:::19606:4:::19606:4:::2998:4:::5035657:4:::</endperson>

5025801::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::26.04.2001::::    I m the kind of person that changes his phone almosts as much as he changes his clothes (well not quite ), so i was instantly attracted to the Nokia 3310. I have previously had other nokia phones (first the 5110 and later the 3210), so the now  traditional  nokia features of being easy to use, attractive looking and X-Press-on Covers and ability to get different operator logos were already clear to me. But what I was more interested where the new features, and the 3110 has many of these   This phone has voice dialling (very handy - and something to impress your friends   ), vibration alert ( I will never again be able to buy a phone that doesn t have this feature), a chat funtion - believe it is similar to texting, but i haven t used to yet as none of my friends have bought the fone yet :( . For anyone interested in the recent  Craze  of ringtones, this is the fone for you - there is space for 7 personal ringtones, which can be either recieved tones or self-composed (which is great).Also this fone is very durable ... i drop it about twice a day, andn as of yet my network coverage hasn t been affected ( a major problem with nokia 3210 s)This phone also has 4 games Snake II (Brilliant), Space Impact (like an old arcade game), Bantium (fun, as soon as you figure out how to play it) and Pairs II (I never play this). The are ideal for passing away boring bus/train/car journeys and even college lectures  You also have the ability to register your scores on the internet to see where you rank in the world.I recommend anyone to buy this fone, it s fun, easy to use, and reletively inexpensive...... and i ve now had my one for almost 5 months - this is my personal record for the lenght of time keeping one fone   And i ve no intentions of changing..     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5026798:3:::5022103:3:::5022103:3:::20081:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5001880:3:::5001532:3:::5285557:4:::5027147:4:::5024424:4:::</endperson>

5022914::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::01.11.2001::::    My Mum paid    130 for a Nokia 3310,but is it really worth it? Well, it has 4 games, a removable cover, it  8217;s pocket sized, simple to get started (well if you read the instructions, unlike me ) and you can download logos and ringtones.                   RINGTONES AND LOGOS  If you look in a recent magazine you  8217;re likely to find a page of them. They display the various logos you can get (such as hearts, the name of your favourite footie team or the band you like best.) but when you actually download them they don  8217;t come out as clear.   The ringtones are either of anthems, theme tunes or songs. It should tell you on that page whether they are available for the phone you own. You also get to do a trial run or tester beforehand to see whether you like it or not. My Mum  8217;s got Slim Shady by Eminem and it sounds nothing like it, thankfully the Doctor Who sounds excellent, just like it does on television.  The phone also has it  8217;s own compositions, one of them is by Mozart and it sounds real cool, it does last a while though. My favourite tune has to be for Christmas, only 55 days till Christmas and I can  8217;t wait  8230;         Anyway, back on subject, a mobile phone is usually bought in case of an emergency away from home. If an emergency did happen, you would want to be able to hear what the person on the other end was saying, wouldn  8217;t  you? Well the problem with ours is you can  8217;t. I don  8217;t know whether the phone  8217;s faulty or all Nokia 3310  8217;s are like that but we sure need to get it sorted out.                     GAMES   SNAKEII   8211; You use buttons 2, 4, 6 and 8 to direct the snake. You have to get him to eat as many bits of food as possible without crashing into himself. Unlike normal Snake, he can go through the walls and come out in the opposite direction.PAIRS II   8211; Using buttons 2, 4, 6 and 8 to direct you and number 5 to reveal. It  8217;s quite similar to a normal game of pairs, but you  8217;re not playing against an opponent and you have a time limit. The hardest level is when the whole screen is full. My top score is 2165   8211; beat that  ;-)SPACE IMPACT   8211; Use keys 8 and 0 to move up and down,   to move forward and * to move backwards. Keys 1 and 3 fire the main weapons and keys 4 and 6 fire the bonus weapons. The first time I played it, I got 2525, but I haven  8217;t yet beaten that score. I think this game  8217;s quite good, but my favourite is Snake II still. BANKUMI   8211; The first time I saw this, I thought   8216;What a funny name   8217; After reading the instructions time and time again, I still don  8217;t get it, so it  8217;s a thumbs down for this one.                   OTHER OPTIONSYou can also change the volume on your phone, hold up to 99 phone numbers in your phone book, send mini birthday cards, set alarms, send and receive text messages, chat (same as you do on the computer, I should imagine) and there  8217;s also a calculator, handy for when you go shopping.It all depends on what you want a phone for, but if it was mine, I  8217;d give it a thumbs up.      ::::5390559:2:::5217276:3:::5022551:3:::5022551:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5079666:4:::3662:4:::5228252:4:::5202056:4:::5101950:4:::5101950:4:::5212054:4:::5212054:4:::5208349:4:::5066647:4:::10438:4:::5027148:4:::5027148:4:::5015516:4:::5093563:4:::5162008:4:::5091046:4:::5026742:4:::5202843:4:::5202961:4:::5202751:4:::5202751:4:::5023064:4:::5066721:4:::5091379:4:::5091379:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::9081:4:::9081:4:::5096783:4:::5016866:4:::5161860:4:::5026754:4:::5026754:4:::3653:4:::10901:4:::10901:4:::5026044:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::5079513:4:::1704:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5096830:4:::9435:4:::5000696:4:::5000036:4:::5000036:4:::5003280:4:::16603:4:::5091135:4:::5091135:4:::5014667:4:::5045921:4:::5045921:4:::23546:4:::5093223:4:::5091531:4:::19911:4:::19911:4:::12236:4:::12236:4:::5090849:4:::5093055:4:::5050855:4:::5050855:4:::3447:4:::5085430:4:::</endperson>

(5146,3210,7110,3310)I remember when the 5110 came out on pay as you go.  I was extremely chuffed so off i went to buy this phone.  If there was a phone to be seen with 2 years ago or he one with the best features it was the 5110.  I still love my Nokia phones so much i have kept virtually every single one of them.  so when the 3210 came out i bought that then the 7110 and i bought that and now the 3310 which definately is the best of the four i have had.The 3310 is crammed full of features lacking only the wap facility which currently wap on mobile networks is not good so in effect this phone is tops.It runs in exactly the same way as all the other Nokia phones out there as it has the trademark Navi Key and the very easy to use Nokia menu structure.Once you get into the phone the menu is split up into 12 sub categories.1. Phone BookThe Phone Book houses your contact numbers and is easily accessed from the standby screen by pressing the down arrow.  It is here that you enter,edit and recall your mobile numbers.The Nokia 3310 has the facility of voice dialling where you simply say the name of the person you wish to call and the phone will dial the number.  To set this up you will find it in this menu and to call somone hold down the navi key from standby and speak after the tone.  The phone dials who you wanted to call then.  It is that simple.2. MessagesMessages houses all your incoming and outgoing text messages.  The inbox can hold an ample number of messages at 10 and is very user friendly.  This phone comes equipped with predictive text messaging which allows the user to simply press the corresponding key only once and the phone will guess the word you are trying to type.  Thus saving your time dramatically.Picture messages can also be sent from this menu and the control of your voicemail settings.3. ChatChat is the new feature from nokia which allows two 3310 users to have a conversation by simply selecting a name they wish to call themselves and typing the message and the phone sends the message and the reply is displayed on the screen  instantly so there is less fussing than a text message.  It is only really useful if you are having a conversation not just a quick message.4. call registerthis houses the details of the numbers you have called, received and missed.  It also shows call duration .5. TonesThe tones menu allows you to set the tone for your current profile and the ability to compose your own tone or have upto 7 tones sent to you from a source such as the internet. You can also turn on the vibrating alert or change the screen saver shown on the screen of the phone when in standby.  You can also urn the volume of tones up and down here.6. Settings   Here the features such as call waiting are turned on and off and the changing of pin codes etc..7.  Call DivertHere is where you will be able to set up where to divert your calls to when turned off or out of signal.  This is normally set to divert to voicemail.8. GamesThe standard nokia snake has been replaced in this phone by  snake 2 which is far better and has a lot more too it such as different mazes and is generally a lot more fun.Space impact is a new one which is like space invaders and you have to clear the levels but only have so much life.  memory is now called pairs 2 on this phone and is a bit more artisitic and has a time trial puzzle and there is the new game bantumi where i do not have a clue about.9. Calculator.The phone simply turns into a calculator and currency converter.10. RemindersYou can type a message into the phone and a time and date to remind you and when that time arrives the phone lights up and an alarm goes off displaying the message on screen.11. Clockhere you set the time,date and have the facility of an alarm clock, stop watch and countdown timer.  Much like an normal sports watch.12.  ProfilesProfiles is where you control the phones sounds to alert you of an incoming call.  there is general, silent, discreet, loud and My style.This allows you to quickly change the settings say if you went into a meeting or a cinema or went into a loud place.  It gives greater variety with much ease.This phone has excellent battery life and talktime.  I have found this phone to be a real gem to me and it has never let me down.  It always picks up a great quality signal with no problem whatsoever.I like the way that you can personalise it by simply clicking on a new cover as you see fit so i can change the colour of the cover more often etc so it is not the same phone all the time.if you need a new phone then go and buy the Nokia 3310 i guarantee you, you will not be dissapointed.      ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5021594:4:::3447:4:::5021892:4:::5020054:4:::5020054:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5016866:4:::</endperson>

3517::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::08.08.2001::::    A phone is a phone, is it not?  So why did I bother upgrading my Nokia 5110 to a 3210 and then to a Nokia 3310?  Read on for the condensed answer, mobiles are boring so I won t go on Really, what can you say about a mobile phone that I could not find out from a website spec?  (see www.nokia.co.uk) Oh well, here goes  8230;.SIZE MATTERS There s no getting away from this one.  Remember the 80s when you required two hands to carry round a mobile phone?  If you don t ask your parents   Noone wants to carry a brick around in their pocket.  Mobile phones have been getting smaller and smaller.  For me the 3310 is about the right size although it could go on a diet and shed a few ounces   Nokia do do a smaller phone, the 8210, but I find that the keys are far too compact on this and the power switch is next to impossible to operate.PRICEThe only other criteria I look at   The 3310 can be had for nothing on most tariffs at the moment (not pay as you go) and as a BT upgrade for me it was also free Oh  8230;.. so far only a fairly helpful op  8230;.shucks, size and price is all I look at (lol )OK,  spose I better tell you what else it does:FEATURES@  Loads of ringtones so you can annoy fellow commuters or, if you are at school, sound cool when you are with your mates @  You can get those natty covers so you can look cool too - or just plain silly @  You can play games.  Personally, if I had wanted to chase my tail (as in snake) I would have been born a dog  8230;..Not improving my rating am I?Try these then  8230;.. @  Vibration alert.  This for me was a good feature.  I never used to hear my phone, now I can feel it instead.  Better still, I can watch my handbag slip across the pub floor as my phone rings @  Ability to have a SMS chat.  All this means is that you can have a conversation with someone through the SMS service and the messages will be displayed above each other rather like in an email that has been sent to and fro without the old message having been deleted.  Strikes me as a quick way for you to rack up your phone bill  8230;C U L8R  8230; (10p)  8230;.OK, Where  8230;  8230; (10p)  8230;.Outside McDs  8230;  8230;(10p)  8230;..OK when  8230;.. (10p)  8230;..What the heck  8230;.not getting much better am I? CLAIRE S TOP TEN REASONS TO BUY THE PHONE1 - It is neat and compact2 - It is easy to operate with Nokia s navi key concept being employed3 - Voice activated dialling - but this only really works when it is not too noisy4 - Good options on the phone book (up to 99 names)5 - You can assign ringtones to different people so you know who is calling andi t vibrates  (and when you play games too )6 - It has predictive text ability so you can write text messages quickly, you can also send pictures.  There are pre-programmed smileys (;-)) and SMS templates too all saving you time.7 - The security settings are excellent, PINs and call barring options available8 - It has screen-savers pre-programmed so you don t get stuck with the boring ones 9 - It is available free on most networks10 - oh, yes, and you can call people on it and they can call you Claire 080801I think I ll go back to my usual style of writing  8230; if this is the first op of mine that you have read, rest assured they re not all like this      ::::5311781:3:::5201953:3:::6758678:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5244830:4:::5223282:4:::5223282:4:::5202056:4:::4454:4:::5095882:4:::5095882:4:::5093350:4:::8316:4:::5079237:4:::5091406:4:::5077103:4:::5077634:4:::5040914:4:::5040914:4:::5066729:4:::5066729:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5066496:4:::23544:4:::5066056:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::19911:4:::19911:4:::5066685:4:::5027279:4:::5026044:4:::5071514:4:::5066180:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5050835:4:::5078395:4:::5078395:4:::17410:4:::17410:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::20081:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5076664:4:::5076664:4:::9435:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::5046089:4:::20353:4:::20353:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::9081:4:::9081:4:::5023993:4:::5035866:4:::5065876:4:::5065876:4:::14682:4:::14682:4:::</endperson>

5342556::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::23.05.2003::::    i have found the 3310 to be easy to use and very allowing for new users. all the features are clearly and obviously named and the menu is simple and easy.the 3310 is also very strong and hard wearing, i have had mine for 2 years now and the screen is still not cracked and there isnt to much dust under the screen, as some phones do get and need to be opened and cleaned often. i have dropped mine on concrete floors down stairs and all sorts and it remains in tact everytime.i would highly recommened the 3310 to anyone wanting to buy a new mobile and to those that want to buy there mum or grand-ma there first phone as it is easy to pick up and learn.it also has the great feture of the alarm clock going off even if the phone is turned off.     ::::5241315:2:::5241315:2:::5284267:2:::5284267:2:::5332164:2:::5246451:2:::5246451:2:::5240190:2:::5202189:2:::5202189:2:::5018201:3:::5018201:3:::5334775:3:::5334775:3:::5347646:4:::5311464:4:::</endperson>

5240548::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::20.04.2003::::    So, my Nokia 5110 was a cronk, so I needed to upgrade  So, what was the upgrade to the 5510? Oh yes, the 3210. Yes, but they don  8217;t make that anymore. Oh, I see  What  8217;s the upgrade to the 3210? The 3310. Oh yes, great  I  8217;ve always wanted that phone So, off I went to the shops, and bought it from the Vodafone shop. At the time it was priced at    100, but now it  8217;s gone down to    80. (Just my bloody luck  Isn  8217;t it always, eh?)So, I was overjoyed with it. It was different. It was funky. It was modern. It was mine. First time round  My last one was third hand, but this was all mine (Haaaaahahaha >evil scary mad man laughSo, I think the first thing I noticed about it was the fact it was very alike the Nokia 5110 and the Nokia 3210. As this was the upgrade to the two phones, I sort of expected this, but they  8217;re as a lot of similarity between the three.Now, I often get questions asked to me about my phone, so I will answer them here, and hopefully they  8217;ll be some help to you.Can you get Logo  8217;s on it?Yes. You can download any logos onto the phone.Can you make your own logos on the phone? No, I  8217;m afraid that wasn  8217;t a feature with the phone, but if you wish, there is something you can buy to attach to the phone, which is called a LogoMaster. It can be bought at most mobile phone shops. But, this won t come with the phone, and you ll have to buy it seperately.Does it have picture messages?Yes, you are given 14 different ones at the start. You can delete some, but others must be kept. You can download different ones onto your phone or get them sent to you by a friend.Does this mean it has screen saver?Yes, it does have a screen saver, which means you can have a logo but a picture will come up if you leave the handset for a certain amount of time. You can have a 5, 10, 20 seconds delay. This picture must be one that  8217;s stored in the Picture Messages in the messages section.Can you download Ringtones onto the phone?Yes, you can download a total of 7 tones, and they will be kept in the tones unless you change them, at a later date.And lastly, does it have Snake 2?Oh yes  What  8217;s your highest score?  8230; Mine  8217;s 2426 Well, back to the phone, and these are the different types of things they have on the menu, and what they do  8230;PHONE BOOK:This is simply a phone book  You can store 100 numbers in it and you can record voice tags. There is a maximum of 10 voice tags. A voice tag is when you record someone  8217;s voice, and then later they only need to hold the OK button down, and say it again and it will phone the number it  8217;s stored under. Good? Well, yeah after 100 attempts  PROFILES:This is the part where you can personalize your different profiles (that  8217;s Discreet, Silent, General, etc) and call them anything you want. Also you can decide your volumes, ringtones, etc for different profiles. Also, if you change the name of it, that will be shown underneath the logo on the front page CLOCK:This isn  8217;t much different to the other clocks on Nokia phones. You can set an alarm, you can have a stopwatch and you can get the date. It  8217;s a pretty good part of the phone, and can, if you wish, automatically get the time updated at spring and autumn, when the clocks go forward/back.REMINDERS:This is the best part of the phone for me  Well if you have a memory like me (None at all ) you  8217;ll need this. If an event is coming up, include the name and details of it fewer than 35 words, set a date and time to be reminded and viola  At that time and date a message will come up on the screen with the details you supplied  And this can be annoying as well, because if you don  8217;t go to the feature on the phone afterwards and delete it, it will keep ringing, which can be a real nuisance and kind of get up your nose  CALCULATOR:What  8217;s more to say? It  8217;s a calculator, what can it do? Well it adds, multiplies, divides and takes away for you GAMES:Well a part that is used often on my phone  It has four games. They are Snake 2, Space Impact, Bantumi and Pairs 2.All are simple to play and have instructions, although it will take you a while to get used to all  But, a good feature, but you might want to put it on Silent as the noises can really annoy you CALL DIVERT:This is where you decide whether you want a voice-mail, and if so, when should it divert to the voicemail  It  8217;s a pretty simple part of the phone, and all you must do is choose from a few options   8211; simple.SETTINGS:This is where you have the settings for the whole phone. Here is where your security settings are, your phone and call setting, and this where most things are stored. Here  you can change whether you want your number to go out when you  8217;re phoning. Whether you want speed dial. Also you can change the welcome note, which is the note you have when the phone turns on. It also has the languages you can have, and is very confusing  Unless you don  8217;t need to, leave this part of the phone to the professionals TONES:Well, apart from the tones you might download later, you have 35 that are already in the phone  They  8217;re pretty cool, and you have a wide range. Here you also choose your message alert tone. You have three choices. Also here you choose the screen saver. Another thing you can do is create a ringtone in the composer part. It is really difficult to do, but you might just be able to do it  And last but not least   8211; the vibator  8230;   8216;nuff said  CALL REGISTER:Here you can delete or just see the last 20 missed calls you  8217;ve had, received calls you  8217;ve had and who you  8217;ve called. Which is good if you think about it  You can also find out the call duration of your last call, and you can find out the cost of all calls  Good eh?CHAT:This is a part I never use and find a sham. When I heard what it was, it is a place where you go to   8216;chat  8217; with a friend, you text her/him and if he texts back, it  8217;s shown in the form it is on a chat room. But, what you don  8217;t know is, if you go away from it or touch one button it  8217;s off, and you wont receive a number and what they  8217;re saying, but just the message  A total waste of time, and Nokia should sort it out I think, don  8217;t you?MESSAGES:Yes  Here you can write a message store 14 messages in an inbox/outbox, store picture messages, templates, smileys, and you can also change your message settings  You may write up to 459 words in a text, but that will be sent as three, and cost you three times as much  But, make sure you don  8217;t go over 160 or you  8217;ll be charged double So, that  8217;s all the features, what they include and what they do. But, what do I think about the phone?I think this is a good phone that is very reliable. It has good battery, that last for around 5 days, and is very compact. You can take it anywhere with you and it  8217;s not a job to keep it. It doesn  8217;t have an aerial, which is good, and it also has pretty small buttons, but large enough to dial/text You can buy covers for the phone, but I think it  8217;s a waste of time  I bought millions for my 5510, but that was because they were so cheap, but with this they can go up to    15 for one If I had to buy a phone again, if this broke, I wouldn  8217;t buy this one. Not because I don  8217;t love it, but because of the new one  8217;s out. I think most people who have this phone are getting bored of it already, and want one of the new 5210  8217;s, and before long this will be the 5510 But, all in all it  8217;s a really good phone, and you can use it and have fun. Playing games or composing a song, it can be a barrel of laughs  So, a good phone that is reliable and modern and has most features. What more do you want?You can buy the Nokia 3310 from most shops now for around    80. You can buy it from the Vodafone, shop, Carphone Warehouse and in most supermarkets  Let  8217;s face it, phones are the new must-have accessory and can be bought almost everywhere  Written By: Matt Roberts.     ::::5368276:2:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5690774:4:::5469307:4:::5368168:4:::5351752:4:::5302563:4:::5342941:4:::5284267:4:::5284267:4:::5337950:4:::5337469:4:::5337469:4:::5279552:4:::5078622:4:::5078622:4:::5207843:4:::5290469:4:::5288024:4:::5288024:4:::5248571:4:::5248571:4:::5332922:4:::5250545:4:::5250545:4:::5309690:4:::5085304:4:::5284133:4:::5284133:4:::5307399:4:::5307399:4:::5286676:4:::5317659:4:::5085331:4:::5301384:4:::5247777:4:::5255273:4:::5161854:4:::5161854:4:::5306198:4:::5306198:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5269811:4:::5269811:4:::5240451:4:::5240451:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5261270:4:::5261270:4:::5126903:4:::5186837:4:::5302637:4:::5302637:4:::5217434:4:::1692:4:::1692:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5327486:4:::5095954:4:::5095954:4:::5270615:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5250720:4:::5250720:4:::5096462:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::5256454:4:::5256454:4:::5308666:4:::5208310:4:::5126937:4:::5126937:4:::10438:4:::5310553:4:::5325668:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5253538:4:::5311794:4:::5311794:4:::5271642:4:::</endperson>

5020889::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::very helpful::::17.07.2001::::    UPDATE: 17/02/02Oh why can t we use question marks in the subject headings? - It just doesn t make sense to write something which really needs some form of exclamation or quotation mark, oh well back to the topic in hand.NOKIA 3310Available through, as far as I am aware, all the major phone networks, including Vodaphone, Orange and BT, and on both contract and pay as you go basis.COSTOn a contract basis, usually free.On Pay as You Go,    129.99, and you can also no longer take them home to be connected, it has to be done in-store.  FEATURESPhone Book with spaces for 150 names (does anyone have that many friends?)Like the 3210 you can assign different ring tones to individual names stored in the book, you also have the option to send birthday cards and pictures to other mobiles, although the recipient may not always have the facility to actually receive them.VOICE TAGSThere is a voice activated feature on this phone, one of the primary reasons I chose it - it is actually quite difficult to use though and relies on the tone of the voice rather than the actual name.TEXT MESSAGESYou can send extra long text messages on this phone, up to three in one go (thats if you ve got both the finger and staying power to go that long), although I do believe all the networks charge you accordingly.You can also set up templates for messages, and send instant smileys and pictures to your friends, again I am not sure what the criteria is for receiving these on other phones which don t have this feature, I tried to send one to my 3210 and it just arrived with my name as the identifier.You also have a chat facility with this phone, although again I am not quite clear what the difference between this and text messaging is, although I am sure someone out there will enlighten me.CALL REGISTERThe phone has a call register, where it logs the last 10 Missed, received and Dialled numbers.  You have the facility to save these numbers, erase individual ones, or erase all call lists in one go.RING TONESYou get 35 pre-set tones, and you can add another 7 of your own tunes, either through the internet, receiving them from your friends, or if you are really brave, composing your own, although from what I have heard they seldom sound like they are supposed to.There are five different volume levels, and you can set the phone to vibrate when it rings with or without a tone present.MESSAGE TONESA choice of 5 different message tones, and again a vibrating alert with or without a tone.DIVERT FACILITIESThese facilities are obviously dependant on the betwork you are using.GAMESSnake 2, an advance on snake I apparently, Bantumi (haven t figured this one - not really being the type to play games on my mobile), Pairs II (I do play this one, and prefer the original on the 3210).  You also have the facility to turn sounds and lights on/off when playing games.CALCULATORYou have a calculator (which is just that - what more can I say), but it does however have a foreign/ domestic exchange feature on it - you input the rates and the phone will convert it for you into the relevant currency, quite handy if you are desperately trying to work out how much that extra bottle of perfume at the airport is going to cost you.REMINDERSYou can add reminder facilities if you have a brain like a sieve like me, and these will work whether the phone is on or off, providing you have the phone set correctly.  CLOCKYou can set the date and time and select how you want them displayed on the screenPROFILESYou can set the profile to what you want, including one of your own profile, allowing you to switch a whole range of ring tones in one go.You also have the facility on the phone to set screen savers from a small range of attractive piccies.  You can change the case-covers for a variety or attractive and not-so attractive plastic covers, providing a)  you can manage to get the original cover off in the first place, and b) you can afford and justify the cost, starting at around    6.99.CHARGINGThe suppliers recommend charging for 16 hours initially, and then periods of up to 4 hours.  The manufacturers recommend that you run the battery down completely a few times and recharge for optimum performance.  I actually had to take my first phone back to the supplier for a new battery, as after charging the battery failed immediately.  Not had any problems since changing this.  Amazingly, I had exactly the same problem with my 3210.  If you need a replacement charger for this phone, it will cost around    20 (managed to get mine stolen in Lanzarote over there they only cost    15 - but are pretty useless back in the UK)SUMMARYI got mine from Uplands Car Radio for free on simple agreement of a contract with BT Cellnet, I also had a hands-free ear-piece, new phone cover, in-car charger and bright green plastic covers.Quite dinky, and aesthetically pleasing and quite nice to use, although other than this, it is not a light phone and in reality little different to its big brother.  Still I have signed the contract and am now stuck with the little darling for the next 12 months or so.UPDATE: 17/02/02I have had mobile phones for around 7 years when they were very cumbersome and hideously expensive - but with this phone I experience something I never have with other phones - my ear gets warm after a very short space of time - this has made me exceptionally nervous about using it - thus I find myself texting more often (cheaper), with all the publicity about health risks I am not quite sure - my daughter has one of these too, and uses it primarily for texting, she probably makes around 10 calls a year on it - and is there purely for emergencies (and texting) and gives peace of mind if she is out with her friends on a Saturday - but it is worrying and I welcome any further research done into the long term health effects of mobiles.And Why has this op been read 79 times by non-members?  bizarreSTANDBY TIME IS AROUND 5 DAYSTALK-TIME IS ABOUT THREE HOURSSUE     ::::5301118:3:::5247309:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5003021:4:::5243805:4:::5248589:4:::5248589:4:::5202501:4:::5202501:4:::5240143:4:::5240143:4:::5247608:4:::5244232:4:::5240000:4:::5079164:4:::5040909:4:::5223282:4:::5223282:4:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::5208443:4:::5208443:4:::5217683:4:::5208318:4:::5202056:4:::5026693:4:::5026693:4:::5202843:4:::5151805:4:::5085331:4:::5080376:4:::5186837:4:::5077810:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::6644:4:::6644:4:::5202678:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::10438:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::5036152:4:::5036152:4:::8689:4:::22063:4:::5079163:4:::5023782:4:::5045874:4:::5071534:4:::5027357:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5027058:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5026044:4:::5055819:4:::5019443:4:::5019443:4:::16615:4:::19911:4:::19911:4:::5030672:4:::19093:4:::19093:4:::5055898:4:::5016866:4:::6636:4:::5040957:4:::5001880:4:::5035800:4:::5046089:4:::5027359:4:::</endperson>

5013036::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::06.08.2002::::    I HATE mobile   8216;phone ops, I  8217;m sorry, but I do   A   8216;phone is a   8216;phone after all isn  8217;t it? Why all this fuss over the newest, smallest, multi-multi-functional ones   Goodness, all you need to do is either talk into it or tap out a small text message, isn  8217;t it?A while ago the top 20 opinions list was teeming with ops about this Nokia and that Ericcson. Aagghh  I can  8217;t say that I didn  8217;t read any of them but admit to saying that I avoided as many of them as I could, apologies here to some of my trusted CoT So, why oh why am I drawn towards doing an op on the very item I so fervently avoided like the proverbial plague not so long ago? And question number two, why on earth should I expect the lovely members of my CoT to read my op on the self same item that I so recently despised  8230;because you love me     ;o)  8230;and Pledge coming up  8230;  8220;I promise to read all other mobile ops of my CoT members from this moment forthwith if you give this one the once over    8221;  Three teenage sons in the family meant the incessant sound of tinny like tunes emanating forth from an assortment of Nokias and I confess here that I was a teensy weensy bit jealous when friends called them up to the sounds such as, The Big Brother theme tune (the second time around), Mission Impossible 2 and Tubular Bells (wide taste in music my lot have  ) But I was accepting of the fact that a perfectly good mobile   8216;phone such as my Trusty Trium had no need to be traded in for a fancier model just so that on the very rare occasion that someone called me I could hear a   8216;cute  8217; tune   So as the years rolled on and the boys tastes in music changed, (have you ever heard Slipknot coming out of a mobile   ) I concealed my hankering for such a   8216;racier  8217; model well hidden Last week Glen broke his Nokia. He walked into something and the   8216;phone was in his pocket; he smashed the screen. He went out and got a new contract   8216;phone (one of these teeniest Samsung A300  8217;s awwww sooo cute  ) and came home and gave me the broken Nokia... never let it be said that my boys aren  8217;t generous  To be fair to him though, he knew that I had wanted a Nokia for a long time and he also knew that I knew a man who could fix screens for a reasonable sum   Last weekend saw me at Felixstowe market handing my newly acquired smashed up mobile to a very nice bloke on the mobile   8216;phone stall there only to return less that 20 minutes later and be handed what I thought was someone else  8217;s brand new Nokia    8220;No love, that is yours,  8221; he assured me.   8220;I have put a new aerial as well as the LCD screen and cover on it for you (it had a grotty old blue plastic broken cover too) and it  8217;ll be    28 please?  8221; he didn  8217;t have to ask twice I handed him the cash, resisted leaping across the stall to plant him a smacker on the cheek and hurried back to the van so that I could play with it all the way home  Bargain  I am now the proud owner of a Nokia 3310  8230;I have to keep asking Glen what model it is  8230;hence the title   I have tons of things that I can now do on it that I could never do on the old Trium (put out to retirement now and only to be used in the case of emergencies, or smashed up screens ) I expect the majority of you reading this will know exactly what a 3310 can do, but please humour me here and let me tell you a bit about it  I have my own greeting on it now...kazziebears...what else? Several picture messages that I can send to people  Different screensavers, the smiley ones are my favourite until I can get someone to send me a cute teddy bear or a naked man    (Only joking  ) It has a reminder facility which as a former scattyredhead I am going to find extremely useful, if I remember to turn the   8216;phone on so that it can remind me that is    I have just switched it on to see a message that Will put in it last night so that I would not forget to get something for him and now all the shops are shut...d  8217;oh  A quick run down of facilities follows: -Phone Book~~~~~~~~~~~Well that is to be expected really, as standard on all phones I would think, heck even my Trium could do that Select, search, add name, erase, edit, assign tone, send b  8217;day card (woo  ) options, speed dial, voice tags, search, etc etc    Ye gods   How am I going to get to grips with all that    Messages~~~~~~~~~Write messages, send them, templates, smileys ;o), settings, information service, yet again this is going to take me months to comprehend Chat~~~~~Haven  8217;t even gone there yet Call register~~~~~~~~~~~~~As above Tones ~~~~~~Now we are talking  :o) You can get tunes sent to your mobiles these days or so I am led to believe, I am now going to go and make up for lost time and catch up on some of the other mobile ops, to see what is about and more to the point, how to do it  Reminders~~~~~~~~~Oops see above:o(   Clock~~~~~Very useful if you don  8217;t wear a wristwatch like me Games~~~~~Yeah right, like I got excited when I got a score of 56 on Snake  Profiles~~~~~~~~Ooer   So there you have it in a nutshell  8230;..a very small one you understand   I have to be honest here and say that I don  8217;t know if you can still buy this model? I do know that Nokia have upgraded it several times since Glen first bought this one and I do also know that they are a damn site more expensive to buy on a pay-as-you-talk tariff these days  8230;rip off:o(   But if you get the chance of secondhand 3310, or even from a reputable market stall, the one I went to comes highly recommended from me and others who recommended it to me, don t hesitate in considering this model.My prime reason for writing this, apart from wanting to share my new little bundle of joy with you, is to say that if you want a half decent Nokia then I don  8217;t think that you can go far wrong if you plump for this model. It weighs more than you would think just by looking at it and I am of the frame of mind that heavier things tend to be better made   *ahem*  What I mean by that is that it doesn  8217;t feel flimsy and feeble.The keypad is easy to use and they make a satisfying little click when you depress them so even in the dark you will know that you have pressed the keys ok...if you are inclined to text underneath the bedclothes then you will be well catered for here  Well you might want to text at night  Concluding by adding that I am soo glad that my son walked into that lamppost (he wasn  8217;t hurt I ought to say ) and made me the proud owner of this little beauty  Now  8230;where did I plant that other lamppost so that I can get his Samsung coming my way next? *Snigger   *Oh and in case you want to text me so that I can enjoy the dulcet tones of Fraggle Rock, my mobile number is  8230;  8230;  8230;Ah ha    You didn  8217;t think I would, did you     Kazziebearsxx     ::::5309724:3:::5217854:3:::5217854:3:::6560332:4:::6560332:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5326218:4:::5326218:4:::5036152:4:::5036152:4:::4738:4:::4738:4:::10438:4:::5240343:4:::5078622:4:::5078622:4:::5202449:4:::5202449:4:::5085331:4:::21963:4:::5217259:4:::4295:4:::4295:4:::5066703:4:::23544:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5012563:4:::5003280:4:::5096829:4:::5085584:4:::5085584:4:::5223519:4:::5022091:4:::5040677:4:::5040677:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::5212075:4:::8689:4:::1763:4:::2256:4:::6239:4:::5211844:4:::5211844:4:::5202123:4:::5066055:4:::15440:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5186837:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5093563:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::5021353:4:::5021353:4:::5016911:4:::19266:4:::5000594:4:::5000594:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::20081:4:::5208443:4:::5208443:4:::5021241:4:::5092284:4:::5080915:4:::5080915:4:::5217507:4:::5093410:4:::5238961:4:::5238961:4:::5223826:4:::5035866:4:::5207600:4:::5207600:4:::5186875:4:::5091987:4:::5091987:4:::5025810:4:::5202512:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::16949:4:::16949:4:::5202843:4:::5208379:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5041033:4:::5041033:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5026033:4:::5095870:4:::5240190:4:::5202678:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::5223809:4:::5223809:4:::5240191:4:::</endperson>

5247579::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::22.09.2002::::    The Nokia 3310, slim, sleek elegant and sophisticated.I purchased one of these handy little phones about 6 months ago and now I couldn  8217;t imagine life without it, It  8217;s the ideal phone for me as it has an unusual array of games, which are unique to Nokia. My original phone was a Vodafone GSM but when that one broke I decided to buy a Nokia 402. This was a brilliant phone for me as it had everything I needed, I decided then and there if I ever bought another phone it would be another Nokia. Any way, after some time I found my beloved 402 in a mangled heap in the bottom of my bag which annoyed me to quite a considerable extent as i m sure you can appreciate. It actually turned out to be a bit of a mixed blessing as it gave me an excuse to buy this little beauty, the Nokia 3310.Before I continue I  8217;ll just mention that this opinion is based on the Pay as you go version and so features will vary from the contract version. The menu supposedly has 12 sections but on the pay as you go version it only has 11 as the number 7 section is missing. I have been lead to believe that this is because the contract version has a number 7 on the menu, which is an additional feature to attract people to buy on contract. This fault was also apparent on the 402 version of the phone.Here is a description of the different menu sections and their features:1) Phone Book, this one is fairly self-explanatory. The extending features of the phonebook are SEARCH   8211; Search for an entry by name of by looking through.ADD NAME   8211; Add and entry.ERASE   8211; Delete an entry.EDIT   8211; Edit a number or name.ASIGN TONE   8211; Assign a ring tone to a specific Number.SEND B  8217;CARD   8211; This sends a birthday greeting to your desired text receiving mobile phone number.OPTIONS: - type of view        -Memory statusSPEED DIALS   8211; Assign keys on your phone to different numbers. VOICE TAGS   8211; Allows you to search and call a number by saying their name into the phone2) Messages   8211; Here you can text, send picture messages to people with text/picture receiving mobile phones.WRITE MESSAGES   8211; Write messages to your friends.INBOX   8211; Saved Messages from people.OUTBOX   8211; Saved messages you  8217;ve sent.PICTURE MESSAGES   8211; Different pictures you can send to other Nokia Phones.TEMPLATES   8211; Time savers, here you can store well used phrases to save you typing them out.SMILEYS   8211; Smiley/angry/funny whatever   8211; here you can store little text pictures.MESSAGE SETINGS   8211; Change your message settings.3) Chat   8211; A built in chat room on your mobile   8211; using the latest in Text messaging technology you can chat with friends in a chat room.4) Call Register   8211; Your phone call settingsMISSED CALLS   8211; Calls you  8217;ve missed.RECEIVED CALLS   8211; Calls you  8217;ve received.DIALLED NUMBERS   8211; Numbers you  8217;ve dialled.ERASE RECENT CALLS LIST   8211; Delete recent calls saved on your phone.SHOW CALL DURATION   8211; Total, last, received, dialled call durations.5) Tones   8211; Your Ring tones on your phone etc.RINGING TONE   8211; The tone that will ring if you have a call.RINGING VOLUME   8211; How loud the volume will be.INCOMING CALL ALERT   8211; How the phone will alert you that you are receiving an incoming call.COMPOSER   8211; Compose your own ring tone.MESSAGE ALERT TONE   8211; How you will be alerted when you receive a message.KEYPAD TONES   8211; How loud the tones are on your keypad.WARNING TONES   8211; On or Off.VIBRATING ALERT   8211; Weather or not the vibrating function will be turned on or not.SCREEN SAVER   8211; Select a picture to come up on your phone after it has been left dormant for a specific length of time.6) Settings   8211; The phones settings   8211; includes factory settings etc.7) Missing on the pay as you go phone.8) GAMES   8211; For the big kid in every one. A little about each game at the end of the menu list.9) Calculator   8211; All the usual functions of a calculator are included + - / X =.10) Reminders   8211; Set your phones alarm to beep and tell you have a job to do or a birthday present to buy etc.11) Clock   8211; All he clock settings including the date etc, Note the date and time will need to be reset if you remove the SIM card.12) Profiles   8211; Different ring tone settings you have stored. There is space for you to edit your own.THE GAMES Snake2*All the features of the old game plus some new ones, this game is very addictive. The snake is more graphically detailed, it can go through walls and there are bonus items to pick up every so often, the quicker you get to them the more they are worth. You can select different mazes to navigate your way around.Space impact*An Asteroids type game, very simple but again one of those old arcade games, which no one can seem to put down. Shoot the baddys and avoid the rocks.Bantumi*While there isn  8217;t a top score for this game, and most people don  8217;t understand it, I really suggest you read the instructions because it is a great game once you learn how to play it Pairs2* Basically a glorified version of the original, a spin off of the old children  8217;s classic.More features  8230;Another brilliant feature of this phone is the Interchangeable covers front and back. Whilst they can be quite expensive it makes a nice Christmas present and makes the phone look brand new. I currently have a Budweiser cover on mine hehe.New ring tones can be got hold of easily and if you don  8217;t want to pay there are many sites which will give you the things to type in on composer to get the tunes.Logos are also widely available from sites such as BoltBlue.com.The virgin version of the phone also has the additional feature of a radio function so it  8217;s definitely worth considering using Virgin as your chosen Network Provider. My personal Preference is Orange.This phone costs around the    100 mark, but many places now are selling it at    130. I would imagine the best places to shop for it are Internet sites such as Amazon.com and Yahoo.com.Thank you for reading, and all comments good or bad are gratefully received.Regards,  Desolate Cash     ::::5309724:3:::5207600:3:::5207600:3:::6389:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5106801:4:::5244830:4:::5245643:4:::5202697:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5101950:4:::5101950:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::5027491:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::10438:4:::5240190:4:::5151822:4:::5151822:4:::5246323:4:::21963:4:::5050869:4:::5240042:4:::</endperson>

5217258::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::24.04.2003::::    This is the 390th op on Nokia 3310 s  I have recently purchased my second Nokia 3310 mobile. My first one has had it  8217;s day, and has finally died on me. I  8217;m not the most careful person in the world, and sometimes things just   8216;break  8217;. I  8217;ve had a 3310 for about a year. My first one was bought directly from a mobile phone shop.Let  8217;s start. The Nokia 3310 is my favourite phone. I have had, and used many different mobile phones, and I keep going back to Nokia  8217;s. I find them to be reliable, easy to use, and usually quite cheap to buy.The Nokia 3310 is 11cms in length and just under 5cms wide. It is 2cms deep and weighs in at 133g. It is quite heavy now, compared to some of the smaller lighter phones that are available. Although not quite a brick.  The phone has quite a standard and simple appearance. There are numbered/lettered keys on the front and up/down/cancel/select keys above these, which is the same as most mobile phones on the market. The back of the phone is plain, and only has a small push in button, that you remove the back cover by pressing. The Nokia 3310 has removable covers, for both back and front.These fascias are available from all phones shops, from the internet, and sometimes from more obscure shops, like supermarkets. They usually range from about    8 -    20 depending on the style. There are some phones covers that are available that actually change the whole shape and look of your phone. The phones themselves are usually priced around    90 now in most phone shops. When I purchased my first one it cost    149.99 but that was when they first came out, and they  8217;re not that modern now, so they re a lot cheaper. You can get them second hand or reconditioned for about    40. If you by them as part of a contract they are usually free with the contract.The functions of Nokia phones are quite fun, and I have found that they  8217;re very easy to use. The 3310 has a wide range of functions they are shown on the menu, and are easily accessible.The Nokia 3310 is the phone up from the 3210.{{{PHONEBOOK}}}The phonebook is the first function that is in the menu. In the phonebook you have the options to search for a number that you already have listed in your phones book. You can add names and numbers to your current list, erase existing numbers and names. You can edit names and numbers, you also have the option to assign certain ringtones to certain numbers. If you do this, you know without looking at the phone, who is ringing, well if you can remember the separate tones for each person. You can also assign a voice tag to each number if you want, and also speed dials, therefore you don  8217;t have too flick through your phone book to find a name, you can just press a number and that person  8217;s number will be dialled. The options facility on the phonebook shows the different way of showing your numbers, and it also states how much memory you have used, for example, how many spaces for names and addresses you have left to fill. I seem to have some really daft numbers in my phone book, when I ve had a look through. Instead of friends numbers and stuff, I ve got the vets, numerous garages for my car and lots of pubs  Although I have got some friends (I don t want you thinking I m odd ){{{MESSAGES}}}In Messages you are able to create and send messages to people in your phonebook, or to any other number. You can view you in box, of messages you have received, and your out box where you can keep messages you have sent to others. There is a option for picture messages, you can store 14 of these on a 3310, and they can be from other people or from places like the internet. The message function also has templates and smileys that you can send. Both I  find a bit pointless. The template one is for lazy people. It  8217;s a half written text, which you finish, and they  8217;re not the sort of texts that I would send anyway. The smileys and just smiley faces made with the buttons on the keypad, which could be made just as easily by clicking the buttons yourself. Your information for message settings, info service and your mailbox number are all stored in the message function on the menu.I find the message function easy to use, although I really hate the predictive text option, I find it annoying, because it always tries to type stupid words, which are nothing like what you re attempting to write yourself. The main things that I use my mobile for is texting people. I find it quick and very effective. Nokia gets top marks from me, for having such a simple text messaging format. It s really easy to use, which is great for all those non-technical people out there (like me ).{{{CHAT}}}I can  8217;t say I have ever used the Chat feature on my phone. The messaging functionality has an easy-to-scroll chat history on your phone screen, and all messages are identified by the chat nickname that you store in your phone.. You can give yourself your own chat name, and every message is sent to the person with the chat name of the sender. As long as the user stays in chat mode, the phone stores all messages into a cache memory without encumbering the phone or SIM card memory until the cache memory is exceeded, the earlier history is truncated but you may continue to chat. The cache memory is emptied at the end of each chat session. (* A cache is a buffer memory, which is used to store data temporarily)   8220;Some of this was taken from the Nokia website, as I wasn  8217;t sure what the feature was actually there for )This seems a bit pointsless to me, and I haven t ever used the option, and I don t know of anyone who has.{{{CALL REGISTER}}}This is a pretty simple feature to use. You have the option to view any missed calls, received calls or dialled numbers. You also have the opportunity to delete all the call lists.  You are able to view the duration that you have used the phone for your last call, all calls, received calls and dialled calls. You can always deleted numbers off these lists, one by one, or all together, you never know when you need to be discreet {{{TONES}}}You have the option to change the ringing tone on your phone with this feature. You have 42 spaces for different ringtones. There are a standard 36 bui8lt in ringtones that are already on your phone when you buy it. There are also 6 blank spaces where you are able to store any new ringtones that receive. You can buy them from websites and over the phone, they usually cost about    1.50. Some websites, although very few, offer ringtones for free. The ringtones they have available are usually very limited though. In the Tones feature you have the ability to change the speed and loudness of your ringtone too. You can also change the settings so that you don  8217;t have it on a continuous ring, you can have ring once, beep once, ascending, and off. The composer option in this feature lets you compose your own ringtones, if you  8217;re talented you can create your own and use it as your ringtone, you can store the ringtones that you create in the empty tones on your ringtones list. In the Tones feature you also have the ability to change how you can acknowledge that you have a message. There are standard beeps and noises, and you can also have it, so your phone only vibrates. This is perfect for knowing you have a message in those quiet places, and also if you don  8217;t want anyone else to know that you  8217;ve received a text message. Key pad tones and warning tones are controlled in this feature too. You can have the keys silent, or with sound.  There are also options to have your phone on vibrate and also whether or not you have a screensaver on the opening screen of your phone. On my old phone I d filled all the blank tones with new tones, but after my phone broke, I lost them all. This phone had two tones on it that weren t standard, and let s just say they weren t exactly great  Needless to say, I don t use them.{{{SETTINGS}}}The settings feature on the mobile phone has 4 options in it. Call settings, Phone settings, Security settings and Restore Factory settings. The call settings option has:Automatic Redial   8211; This redials the number that you are trying to ring if the first time you call, your call is unanswered.Speed Dialling   8211; This lets you use the numbers on your keypad as a quick dial way of ringing a number. You can have 9 people on this list and just by pressing that number it  8217;s a quick way of ringing them without having to scan through your phone book or type in their number.Call Waiting options   8211; Here you are able to activate, and cancel call waiting on your phone. If you have call waiting activated it means, if your already speaking on the phone the phone will beep to let you know that another call is waiting to get through.Own Number Sending   8211; It  8217;s a bit like using 141 before dialling a number. You are able to hide your telephone number before you ring someone.The phone settings option has   8211; Language   8211; You can change the language of your phone, but there  8217;s really no need to do this, unless you  8217;re having a fiddle.Cell info Display   8211; To be honest I don  8217;t know what this does  But you can switch it one and off  Welcome Note   8211; Here you can write a message or something funny that will be shown on the opening screen of your phones.Network Selection/ Confirm SIM service actions   8211; should both be left alone, I don  8217;t know what they do but I bet I could break my phone by playing with them  In the Security settings option you can bar certain calls, and activate a pin number that must be used before using the phone, it  8217;s a bit too much of a faff on for me. To restore the factory settings on the phone you need a pin number.It s very rare that I change these setting, I normally have my phone on the same settings, and same style all the time.{{{CALL DIVERT}}}It  8217;s pretty much what it says it is. There are a variety of different ways to divert your phone. Divert all voice calls without ringing, divert when busy, divert if not answered, and lots more. I don t use this function much either, as I m nosy and I don t like to miss out on any phone calls that I m going to get, I m deprived, you know? {{{GAMES}}}The phone has 4 different games featured on it. *Space Impact   8211; It  8217;s a lot like Space Invaders. It  8217;s quite easy to play and fun.*Bantumi   8211; It  8217;s a game where you have to get the most points by beating the computer. You need to get the highest number in your basket to beat the phone.*Pairs II   8211; I hate this game. You have to match two pictures together to score points.*Snake   8211; Probably the most popular game on phones at the moment. You have to guide a snake around the screen of the phone eating up the little dots and food while you  8217;re doing it. You mustn  8217;t hit the walls or yourself.Odd times I ll have a quick go on Snake or a go on Bantumi, but I don t usually play on the games. And I hate it when you see people on the bus/train, etc sitting playing on games and stuff, or just fiddling with their mobile in general, I think it s really annoying.{{{CALCULATOR)))Pretty obvious really. It can come in handy when you  8217;re out and about. Especially in supermarkets and suchlike, to make sure you  8217;ve got enough cash  I use it occassionally, if I m having ablonde day or I m desperate.{{{REMINDERS}}}Here you are able to store alarms to remind yourself of something you need to do. Your phone beeps and you get a type of text message to remind you. I think this is quite a good little feature. Its s handy to use, and great if you have a memory like mine, you can set the time you wnat it to go off, so if you re going somewhere then you can set it so you re in a certain shop and you re reminded of what you wnat. I use this quite often, if there s something that I need to remember, but am likely to forget about.{{{CLOCK}}}On this option you can put an alarm clock on to wake you up in the morning (or try to wake you up, I can sleep through it ). You can change the clock settings, date settings and there  8217;s also a stop watch and a countdown timer. Sometimes the alarm is ok, but I m quite a deep sleeper (deep, usually as in dead)and I can sleep through most things.{{{PROFILES}}}This is a way of recording styles for your phone, which feature ringtones and screensavers etc. Each different profile has a different name. I think it s a bit of a pointless feature, and I think in was something that Nokia decided to use to fill up some space on the phone.{{{MY SERVICES}}}This has all the features that 02 provide. Dictation Line, RAC Breakdown, Customer Care and loads more. It  8217;s quite a helpful little feature this one. It s good to know that the numbers are all there, and you can dial them without having to mess about flicking through your phone book.Well there you go. All the features of the Nokia 3310 listed, it took me a while. Overall I love this phone. Everything is so easy to use and is very simple yet sophisticated  Thanks for ReadingCat      ::::5352806:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5246782:4:::5582813:4:::5469307:4:::5283721:4:::5315183:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5241799:4:::5305389:4:::5284761:4:::5207843:4:::5297072:4:::5241196:4:::5333015:4:::5085480:4:::5085480:4:::5269811:4:::5269811:4:::5217069:4:::5217069:4:::5040677:4:::5040677:4:::5253538:4:::5288404:4:::5334094:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::5241280:4:::5241280:4:::8689:4:::5030684:4:::5030684:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::5255156:4:::5310553:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5333339:4:::5308666:4:::5270615:4:::5240200:4:::5311952:4:::5126903:4:::5085343:4:::5085343:4:::5085304:4:::5252799:4:::5096508:4:::5096508:4:::5025486:4:::5025486:4:::6389:4:::5243640:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5202225:4:::5223538:4:::5333937:4:::5414179:5:::</endperson>

5066395::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::21.11.2001::::    No, I m not kidding. This is the 313th op on the Nokia 3310 in Ciao at the moment. Popular wee beastie, isn t it? I ve decided to do another  unresearched  op here - no going into the phone s technical specifications (frequency, brochure battery life, etc). Nope, I m just going to tell like it is - how I find the phone, and how it suits me and my lifestyle. That s got to be more helpful than a pile of facts or figures, surely? Whaddaya mean,  No ? Well rate me UH and bugger off if you feel like that then Ahem, sorry. Rant over.SPECS:Right, my wee Nokia 3310 with it s spanky blue Zebedee cover (cost a tenner from thecoverstore.com, a recommended website). It weighs 133g, or 162g in its wee black case thingy. This weight is just fine - hefty enough to actually be able to feel it in your pocket or on your belt, but not so heavy as to feel like you re carting a brick around. The battery life is quite good - I switch mine off at night, and it usually needs recharged after 3 days of use, unless I ve been using it a lot more than usual. It s about 4.5x1.5x0.5 inches in size, and is, in my opinion, the perfect size for a mobile phone - although mine lives in its wee black pouch attached to my belt (I like to  draw  it like a gunslinger when it rings. And before you ask, I m 26 years old and I do have a life), it fit s nicely into any pocket without causing a massive bulge (oo-er Mrs) or any discomfort. The buttons are just a fine wee size for my not-at-all-chubby fingers, navigation through the menus is nice and straightforward and the whole thing looks a bit like a pocket phaser from the original Star Trek series. Everything s fine and dandy here.GIZMOS:You can buy the usual array of accessories for the 3310, although the only one I own is a hands-free kit for when I m driving (cost a tenner, available from any phone shop or decent website). I d like a car-kit, but unfortunately my car doesn t have a cigarette lighter for it to run from. Arse.KNOBS AND WHISTLES:Hehehehehehehehehehehehe. The 3310 has a lot of stuff that the technophile (that s me) loves to play with. Games (Snake2, Pairs, Bantumi, and the quite cool Space Impact - my current high score being 8955. I m brilliant I am). The phone has a stopwatch, clock, calculator, calendar and alarmclock facility, and is just a great wee pocket companion. You can buy various express-on-covers (mine is Zebedee from The Magic Roundabout, but you can buy literally dozens of different ones - my girlfriend has one that looks like a Flake wrapper). You can add 7 ringtones to the 35 that are already present to give a total of 42 (I got a C for Higher Maths at school ), and you can either type these in yourself or have them sent from another phone. Cool, huh?KNOBS AND WHISTLES THAT I ACTUALLY FIND USEFUL:The aforementioned ringtones can be individually assigned to different numbers in the 3310 s phonebook (capacity of I think 100, mine contains 72. Including the local Pizza Hut, in case of a pizza emergency), meaning that up to 42 people can be given individual ringtones  This is very useful, as you know who s phoning before you even look at the screen of the phone. Although my mate Billy objected that  his  ringtone on my phone was the theme from the Muppets. Also, the text messaging facility has  predictive text input , meaning that the phone will predict the word you re typing with the minimal number of key presses. Now, at first I absolutely HATED this, as the phone steadfastly refused to show the words I wanted. However, with a bit of perseverance (and inputting new words into the memory), this has become a major time-saver for me. After all, most of the texts I send are pretty much similar, so now that my phone has  learned  them, I can knock them out quite fast. The voice-dialling feature is useful as it effectively doubles the number of speed-dials you can have, and the vibrating alert s useful for if you re in a very quiet or loud place. And you get a cheap thrill from it too.OTHER PLUSSES:I upgraded to this phone from a Siemens C25 (good phone), which in turn I had upgraded to from a Sagem RC615 (cracking good basic phone for mobile virgins), and have found it superior to both, not just in capability but in SHAPE. The 3310 is smooth, with no excresences at all - unlike most other phones which have whacking big aerials sticking out of them, which have a tendency to dig in to various bits of your anatomy. The  profile  facility lets you set your phone s various facilities up to your own specs, and you can even download  operator logos , wee pictures to replace the dull  vodafone  or  orange  (etc) that shows when you re on your network (a word of warning - once you download a logo, you ll never get your original  word  back. As if you d want it back ). MINUSES:I can only think of 2. Firstly, my phone has a tendency to completely switch off when it drops off the network signal. We all suffer from mobile phone  blind spots , areas where whatever network you re on (vodafone in my case) doesn t reach (basements, built-up areas, or just areas with no coverage). When my 3310 goes without a network signal for about 2 minutes it just switches off completely. Now I know that this is to conserve battery power, but I can find it quite frustrating - the phone can switch off without me knowing it, and 5 hours later I find out, switch it back on and discover the future wife has left me 4 irate voicemails. The other bad thing is the price - it s quite expensive. Now I got mine for    20, but this was as an upgrade on a contract, so it costs a lot less. Normal 3310 purchase price is (I think) somewhere around    100 or so, although it s coming down a bit now. So alright, it s a bloody good phone, but you have to pay for the privilege. Oh, and one more - there are a couple of things on this phone that just never get use, like the  chat messaging facility - but then, I suppose that s just me, and other people WILL use them. Ok then, I take that back. Carry on.OVERALL:I love this wee phone. It s practical, just the right size, just the right weight, has a few gadgets to keep me happy, and above all, does the job it s supposed to do very well. It fits my hand perfectly, the screen is a fine size, and it s very easy to use. Although I might upgrade from this to another phone in the future, right now I m perfectly happy with the phone I ve got, which is really the highest recommendation I can give it.     ::::5252204:3:::5252204:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5324369:4:::5027058:4:::5278512:4:::5253092:4:::5202056:4:::5217683:4:::5085462:4:::5085462:4:::5126819:4:::5126819:4:::23544:4:::5093284:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::5101951:4:::5066721:4:::6239:4:::5023074:4:::22022:4:::5085331:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5096111:4:::5096111:4:::5085330:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::23074:4:::3680:4:::3680:4:::5091767:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5035866:4:::5003505:4:::5003505:4:::5077810:4:::9435:4:::19851:4:::19851:4:::5026536:4:::5026536:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::</endperson>

5026772::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::23.05.2001::::     I used to have a Nokia 402 and thought it was the brillent and nothing was better than it until it broke by dropping it, so I wondered on by to my local phone shop and there it was..........the new nokia 3310    Its light, small and compact and it does everything you could possible want - from voice dialling to speed dialling to vibrate... The list is endless. This truly is the best phone ever   Well first of all I use my phone a lot for texting mates, the 3310 has predictive text messaging like the 3210 (which makes your phone appear strangely psychic, it makes it easier and you don t have to press all the buttons loads of times). It also featured condensed messaging, which lets you write up to 459 characters instead of 160. Don t be fooled though - if you go over the 160 it will charge you the price of two messages, and over 320 characters, it will charge you the price of three. Although in it s defence - the nokia user friendly card gets played again as it tells you which, out of three, messages you are on, so you can see if you have gone over. It offers new games which include snake two (loads better). It now has the ability to pass through all the walls (when on  no maze ) and the choice of 5 mazes, the small animals available after every 5 regular  balls  of food - this game is great fun. tip - try to get the animals as quickly as you can for maximum points. Pairs is alright, not great. Basically it is just the old card game, but with quite poor pictures on the cards. I really like the profiles. You can change what sort of ring tones and what level volume etc for different occasions for example we ain t allowed phones in school so I have it on no ringer and no vibrate etc but I changed silent so it has a vibrate so I can use it for like when im in the cinema Another brilliant feature is reminders you can get your phone to remind you about birthdays, appointments, and reminders about when favourite TV shows start.....etcI don t really find stopwatch and screensavers that amazing  Although Now a days you can download quite goos screensavers off the net.You can have up to 10 of your own ring tones from the Internet or made yourself. I currently have Electric Avenue, Guility conscience, purple hills, heaven is a half pipe and Angel by shaggy. I think its really ace the way you can have a ring tone for each person in your phone book (phone book capacity depends on sim card network - orange just talk 150 names.) I find this really handy cos you know who is calling you before you look. That s if  you can remember who has what ring tone assigned..... Theres also the logos that you can get with most nokia phones. You can download these off the internet at sites like boltblue.com or you can ring up places and buy them.The covers are easy changeable and just slip off easy. I currently have a blue one but I want a tigger one    Any way there are loads available and you can buy them in most phone shops, in places like Argos and I can get them off my local market so you should look. They generally seem to be cheaper there yet I still find them expensive   *************As i said the best phone yet  ***********Oh yer another thing it seems to be quite strong i mean me be really clusmy i dropped it today the covers came off and crashed in the middle of the road, i screamed and walked over in dread to check the damage   To my suprise there wasn t even a scratch  Ive neva been so relived. But i dont advise trying to repeat my clumsyness you never know i could of just been lucky  There also a extra feature on this phone known as chat. This is basically like send text messages. Pointless really as it would be cheaper and quicker to actually ring the person.The only real problems i have with this phone is its high price and the battery durability. The battery seems to run down quite quickly espically if you have it on vibrate and use the games alot.Now new phones such as the 3330 which is fairly simalar to the 3310 is out. Im gonna stick to this phone for a while though, it seems to suit my needs      Thanx for reading my opinion  Feel free to leave a comment and give me your ideas Also I have recently edited this opinion. I would like to comment on my comments for this opinion. John stevens wrote that i had copied his review. Well this isnt true. This so called John Stevens has been kicked off ciao for creating multiple accounts and for copying other reviews. I try to write honest reviews to the best of my abiltiy.

23413::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::21.03.2001::::    this phone is everyones dream come true well it is in my eyes, its small, sexy and vibrates :o).i got this phone as a xmas pressie, although i was a bit dissapointed as i had to get rid of my 3210, well i was for about 5 minutes as i realised how fantastic this phone is.it has features that the Nokia 3210 didnt have such as:chatsmore ringtonesmore composer room for songs to download or to create yourselfSNAKE TWO and other gamesReminders (which is fantastic for me as i have a memory like a fish)Screen savers( where you can have a picture of loats of programmed stuff such as coffee, palm trees, etc although you can download your own sreen savers, and there are many to choose from including lots of porn ones)and profiles which you can customise you phone with.i think this hand set is ideal for everyone but each to us own, a phone which is certainly for clubbers, those with not a lot of room to carry stuff, and brilliant for students.this is phone is so easy to use and makes chatting a lot easier as you can chat in the chat room on your phone. this phone looks fantastic, the battery usually last 3 to 4 days with it being switched on all night, if your talking on your phone for long you might experience it going off as it doesnt really have a long talk time.this phone is certainly the best Nokia have ever some up with.have a look down at your nearest store     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::22828:3:::22828:3:::5002383:3:::5022394:4:::23544:4:::5016621:4:::5016621:4:::5001532:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::</endperson>

5025674::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::26.04.2001::::    I have had my nokia 3310 since january this year and i have to say it is an excellent model.  Both stylish and practical, they are definitely a cut above the competition. Even with its original austere grey cover you feel proud to use it in the street and be seen using it by as many people as possible   This is not to mention the fantastic array of different colours to jazz up and personalise your phone.  Some of its excellent features include voice-activated dialling, alarm clock, stop watch, three games (snake ii is extremely addictive, as is space impact, a bit like space invaders) and vibrating alert which is extremely useful when you don t want your phone to be heard.  You can even personalise your screen to say any phrase upto 10 characters long, as well as adding logos.  A smaller and thinner model than the 3210, this is by far the most popular model in the UK and after owning one for 4 months, it s easy to see why.  At    90, it isn t particularly cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.  I wouldn t choose anything else but a Nokia phone.     ::::5202843:2:::5020146:2:::1177:3:::6668:4:::</endperson>

5045992::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::11.07.2001::::    I bought this prduct beacause of all the hype that surrounds Nokia phones. However since purchasing my Nokia 3310, new phones such as the Seimans C35i and Sony J5 have appeared on the market and im my oppinion the are both alot better than the 3310. The Sony J5 is awesome, with great sounds, games and much more capability than my Nokia 3310. Ths Sony J5 is smaller lighter and battery life is alot better then that of the 3310. On the practical side the 3310 is ok, but the tones and games arnt really as good as those on the Sony J5. Also the sounds on the Nokia 3310 are just beeps the SOny J5 uses real sound and has a better speaker. Im not happy with my 3310 i wish i had a Sony J5.     ::::7026:3:::7026:3:::5035866:3:::5046117:3:::5046117:3:::</endperson>

5001930::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::19.01.2001::::    UPDATE------------------------------------------------------------------Following several comments, and a little investigation, I wish to add that the 3310 does NOT have a larger memory than other phones UNLESS you have a bigger Sim Card.------------------------------------------------------------------------Fantastic 100 percent phone. God, they re nice. Grrr.. what envy. I hate my friend that has one  I NEED ONE NOW   This phone is gorgeos, easy to use, works well, good games... oh, and it makes good calls too.The ring tones and games are attracting many people to these phones, and the sequel to Snake, originally named Snake II, is very, very ingenious, although not too easy Problem: Nokia 3110=     How to solve? Comment and tell me It s a nice size, too. It fits nicely into the palm of my hand, and is not to small, like the 8210. If you put the 8210 down, then you might need to get your magnifying glass to find it.The 3310 has a huge standby time and is also very strong, making it one of the best phones on the market.The 3310 has a great operating systems, huge memory capacity, is easy to use, uses attractive icons and is just fantastic  Buy it now - because it s truly great.     ::::5013640:2:::5013640:2:::9444:2:::9444:2:::4142:2:::4142:2:::13861:2:::13861:2:::23574:2:::23574:2:::17253:2:::17253:2:::5202843:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::1669:4:::1669:4:::</endperson>

5036146::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::07.07.2001::::         The Nokia 3310 is an update of the 3210 so i wasn t expecting a lot of new features just a better one than the 3210, if thats possible , well it certaintly is, its lighter and much smaller than its younger brother, the keypad feels more responsive and the battery life is much better, lasts days on standby.     The menu s are the same apart from two new features, a text related one where your previous message is saved and you can talk to the same person with much better ease (introduced due to the couple of billion text messages sent around the world every year) and the other a reminders page, for all those important dates (your anniversary ).When you write a text message now you can get 400+ characters, costs three message prices but saves you remembering where you finished on the previous screen.     If you, like me like to know when you get a text message descreetly then you ll be glad to know a vibration feature has benn included.     You also get new and more challenging games, an improved snake game, space impact(retro or what ), Bantumi(the best, very addictive) and a Pairs 2.     You also get the very helpful and time saving predictive messaging service caried over from the Nokia 3210.The phone predicts which word you are writing from the most likely and if wrong you press one button to go through other possibilities and even add your own.To type say hello on another phone you d press 4 twice, 3 twice, 5 three times,5 three times and 6 three times but with the Nokia 3310 the word hello will form after pressing each number once(In response to nadams question).     The Nokia 3310 is a blistering package and a worthy successor to the Nokia 3210, only    30 more but definitely worth the extra money.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::17410:3:::17410:3:::5045836:3:::6636:3:::5000594:3:::5000594:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::10438:3:::5035771:3:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5023993:3:::5035982:3:::11901:4:::5091671:4:::5035886:4:::2535:4:::5040828:4:::5066400:4:::5066400:4:::23055:4:::5046036:4:::</endperson>

5040677::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::10.06.2001::::    My husband surprised me for christmas by buying me the ctest little phone on the market, the 3310 and i love it.It is the one of the smallest phones on the market and I wouldn t part with it for anything.Every day i find out something new about my phone.Me and my husband are both on Vodafone tarrifs and we found out only the other day that you can send ten free text messages a day from a website called Vizzavi (under the Vodafone website) also you can download Graphics and ringtones at 35 pence instead of the rip off    3 or    4 charged by premium rate phone numbers, but you have to be on Vodafone tarrif.How could anyone like any other phone better? Well my husband likes the 7110 but then he has hardly any sense.You have a choice of ringtones (30+) and can compose or download 7 more and it has a vibrating mode for when its not convenient for the phone to ring out loud.There is also voice activated dialing which i think is great.I have also bought a new cover for my 3310, a budweiser bottle cover, there are lots to choose from, I got mine from the L8 website which was quite good.The best thing about the phone is that is so small that you can fit it in your pocket and forget its there I would reccommend this phone to anyone 100 .     ::::5186837:3:::5092284:3:::5040957:3:::5000287:3:::23074:3:::16615:3:::5035982:3:::5012030:3:::5012030:3:::5000594:3:::5000594:3:::20081:3:::5002171:3:::5078929:4:::3653:4:::</endperson>

9081::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::24.07.2001::::    I have a company mobile and recent we were upgraded to the Nokia 3310 from the 5510 (about time too ).  The phone asthetically is compact and neat looking.  It has a decent volume level.  So what does it have to offer?PHONE BOOKYou can store up to 100 names in your address book and do the usual search, edit or erase.  Also you may assign a particular tone to a name - for instant recognisability   There is a speed dial facility so that you can assign names to no s 1 to 0.  Finally there is a voice tag facility to offer voice activated dialing.MESSAGESYou can send both picture messages and SMS texts.  It can store up to 15 received messages at a go and an envelop will flash on the main screen should you hit your limit so you can have a clear out.  Messages can be written in 2 formats long or short hand - to be honest l have not got the hang of the short hand formatt - l prefer the long way  CHATOther 3310 handset owners can have a long SMS text chat with you.CALL REGISTERWhere you may find out about missed, received, and dialed calls.  You may clear all call lists from hear or find out how long you were on your last call forTONESMy favourite area.  The handset has 35 preset tones in total but it has room for 7 downloaded tunes.  Sites such as www.dialaring.co.uk or www.yourmobile.co.uk provide this service - careful though they can be expensive.  At present l have the theme tune Fraggle Rock You may also compose your own tune and activate a screen saver.SETTINGSYou may change the language, security settings and so on.GAMESFour games exist - Snake II, Space Impact, Bantumi and Pairs II.  Snake II is my favourite - you must eat the food to make the snake grow longer - it can be pretty addictive CALCULATORApart from the usual it also has a nifty currency convertor inbuilt too.REMINDERSPreset your reminders in your phone  - up to 10 can be preset.CLOCKWith the usual alarm functionPROFILESYou may preset tones alerts etc to differing noise levels.OVERALLThe front and back cover can be changed - it comes usually in a basic grey.  All the usual accessories can be bought - car kit and so on.  I find it a very good phone as it is small and light BUT not overly and l can find it in my handbag   It also has a vibrating alert  - so watch out   I really would recommend it to all age groups.     ::::5096929:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202056:4:::5085349:4:::5085349:4:::5091406:4:::5071472:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::23544:4:::5035798:4:::10968:4:::10968:4:::4326:4:::5046041:4:::5046041:4:::5079163:4:::5079178:4:::5055926:4:::9435:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::14682:4:::14682:4:::5066687:4:::5016911:4:::5046089:4:::3653:4:::5026044:4:::16615:4:::3447:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::6636:4:::20081:4:::5025696:4:::3517:4:::3517:4:::6239:4:::5027359:4:::</endperson>

5012269::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::02.02.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is a relatively new phone that Nokia have brought out recently and so far it has proved a great success. I personally like this phones image and look very much. Like any other Nokia phone, it contains a wide range of utilities which include games, messaging, the ability of different ring tones, logos and all the others which you have previously experienced on Nokia phones such as Express on covers for those of you who like to have your phone looking its best. This feature is available on both sides unlike some other phones that you may have previously used. On this phone you also have what many others do not. You have the opportunity with Nokia to keep connected to people with the Nokia 3310. The phone has a built in chat feature which allows you to have text message conversations with other phone users - just like online internet chatting which I think is extremely good.Also with your Nokia 3310 you have some of Nokia  8217;s less famous features which include there vibrating feature, time management functions, voice dialling, picture messaging, predictive text input and many more new games. If you are perhaps feeling bored with your current phone, especially if it isn  8217;t a Nokia phone, I think this would be a good move for you. The phone is available on Pay as you Go with BT Cellnet now as well as being available on  contract from nearly all major mobile phone network suppliers.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5017655:3:::5015288:3:::5014942:3:::5014103:3:::2628:3:::10539:3:::5020702:4:::5018717:4:::5018705:4:::5018697:4:::5018691:4:::5017747:4:::5013793:4:::15861:4:::5013817:4:::5012532:4:::</endperson>

20776::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::16.07.2001::::    Now I have never been one to buy the latest phone and all the gizmos, so to others it would be strange that I am even attempting to write an opinion about one.I bought the nokia 3310 on a contract about 2 months ago after my lovely Panasonic one had died a death and I couldn  8217;t find a battery charger replacement (anyway that is another story ), I went into car phone warehouse and there two VERY helpful salesman introduced this little angel into my life. Now why did I call it a little angel? Well I have to say it has to be the best phone I have got yet.They offered me a choice of three different Nokia phones on the contract system that was suitable and preferential to me and I chose this one. Why? Well initially (and you can call me tight) I got this because it wasn  8217;t going to cost me a penny and I liked it because it is small and diddy and exactly what I required for work.What this phone has:As soon as you get into the menu of this phone you have the following options,PhonebookMessagesChat (haven  8217;t sussed this one out yet, Doh )Call registerTonesSettingsCall divertGamesCalculatorReminders (ever so handyClockProfilesInformation.So lets start with,Phonebook     In your phonebook you can list hold as many as 150 names and numbers so if you need for a business purpose I imagine this could prove to be very handy. You can do a variety of things from sending a birthday card to having a cool little ring for each different person from your address book phoning.Messages     I love the messages part of this phone mainly because you can have a dictionary set up to use which can be a godsend to some, or you can if in a hurry use some of the ready made texts that are available, for example, * Please call. I  8217;m at home and many others that save you from typing oit also you can add your own words into it so saves even more time.  You can also insert a variation of symbols and smileys, which can be fun if you are at work and know that you cant, really send a written text but these are quick and easy to use.Chat Now I have to confess to being totally ignorant here, but I  8217;ll tell you what I think it is. I think it is where if one of your friends is texting you and you are replying back I presume you can set this chat thing up so that you don  8217;t have to keep texting to and fro, instead just type in something similar to what you would on a p.c. I might be wrong and if I am then please feel free to enlighten me in the comment section ;-)Call register  This is the same as any other call register that any mobile phone user is familiar with but with this it is particularly helpful if you are on a contract as it tells you exactly how many minutes you have used and lets you reset the timer when you have either used your free minutes up (with me its 60 minutes) and can also be used for many other things.Tones   There are many tones to choose from and when I purchased my mobile they gave me 4 scratch cards to choose some more tones for my mobile, these varied from chart music to whatever takes your fancy.  The overall tones set up in the phone are okay and what you would normally expect for a mobile of today and the great thing is you can personalise every tone to each person so you know who is ringing and for what.SettingsThese are so you can adjust everything you need to make your phone suitable to your individual needs. From call to security settings.Call divertThe usual, set up voice calls so if you aren  8217;t available they go straight to your answer phone and other things like that.GamesNow these I wasn  8217;t impressed with but then given the games on offer I suppose they are okay if you are REALLY bored, they are very arcade and they remind me of games from the 80  8217;s but hey you cant have everything.Calculator Well as you all know a calculator is what it says and this is extremely useful to me at work as I can just use my phone to work out figures instead of hunting round for the calculator, and it means I can text whilst pretending to work something out ;-)RemindersI love this facility, if you need reminding of something this is great and the best thing is that it will not stop reminding you until you have erased your original reminder so you can guarantee you wont forget anything again.ClockThis is what I would say a glorified alarm clock, good little feature.ProfilesThis is the section where you can totally personalise everything in your phone from screensavers to call barring.InformationThis offers you information on the following sections. Sport.LifestylesFinance A bit like the news it offers you what has happened in the before category today.So that is oit for what the phone has in the menu.Additional informationThe phone is lightweight and weighs around 133g (with a standard battery). After charging the battery lasts around 5 days, which is excellent.You have a vibration method on the phone when a call or text message is being received so this invaluable to me as I wouldn  8217;t hear it usually.Full graphics display so great for those picture texts.All in all a great little phone.I am on the orange network and I find this brilliant for my phone and I get a signal almost anywhere so that is a definite thumbs up for me      ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5690774:4:::5469307:4:::5305309:4:::5035657:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::17410:4:::17410:4:::6389:4:::5016866:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::5027146:4:::5045797:4:::5036242:4:::5036242:4:::</endperson>

7813::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::14.06.2001::::    Nokia 3310eI m not usually an angry person, but I recently damaged my Nokia 3210 phone by throwing it in a wild rage. It helped calm me down, however, it showed me life without a mobile phone, which, I can tell you, is not pretty  Anyway, this could not go on, and I couldn t go out and get another phone because of a lack of funds. So, when a mystery parcel arrived for me at work containing a brand new phone, I was impressed to say the least  I opened the package and there sat a brand spanking new Nokia 3310 The features on this phone are just endless, and the whole look and shape of the 3310 are very sleek and modern.What s on the menu?-Phone Book-Messages-Chat-Call Register-Tones-Settings-Games-Calculator-Reminders-Clock-ProfilesThe Phone Book.You can store up to 100 names and numbers and there is a simple search facility, when you want to find that lucky person you are about to ring. It is very simple to Add, Erase and Edit a particular name and number, and there is even an option where you may assign a particular tone for that special person  When browsing through your numbers, you can choose various different styles of layout for the details. You can have both the name and number together in the list, just a name list, or a name list in a large font, for those who like it big  When both the name and number appear on the screen at the same time in a list, it is easy to see the number, but when it is just the names in a list, then you have to push the hash key to view the number.    You can assign speed dials for 9 of your favourite people, to save time. For example, if you wanted to phone Uncle McKeith in Scotland, then you only have to dial 3 then call. The number will be dialled automatically. Another quite nifty feature is the voice tags, where you say the person s name and it calls them up for you. I think you can stre about 10 of these.This phone has a mind of its own, which is great for me, because I lack in that department   :)Messages.You can write, receive, save and edit messages on the phone, and there is a storage capacity of 15 messages in total. When writing a message, there is the option of writing it long hand or short hand, kind of thing. For example, the regular way of writing hello is by pressing 4 twice, 3 twice, 5 three times, wait a second, then 5 three more times and finally 6 three times. This way is the normal way, but takes longer. The easier way is to activate the inbuilt dictionary, (The phone has an inbuilt dictionary, which predicts what you are going to say) and then pressing: 4,3,5,5,6. The phone will automatically predict the word hello. When the word you are trying to type does not appear instantly, press the * button until it does. If your word doesn t show, you will get the option to spell the word. Once spelt, the word will be stored in the phone for later usage. [Please note that the phone does not already have all of the swear words in its database, so you will need to add them in manually. :) ] There is also space for 8 picture messages on the phone. There are several message templates on the phone such as  I will be late, meet me at..  These are to again save you time and effort. You can receive delivery reports, which tell you whether the person you sent a message to has received it, or not.Chat.This is a great function where you can chat to other 3310 owners. I have never used it, but have heard highly of it.Call Register.This is the phone s history. It shows the last dialled numbers, missed calls and received calls. If you want to know how long your last call lasted, you will find out in here.Tones.There are 35 preset tones on this phone, all of varying standards, my favourite being,  Hurdy-Gurdy  (Number 27) There is also space for 7 extra tones which you can compose yourself of download from the internet.Several sites I have found are:www.texer.comwww.iobox.co.ukwww.yourmobile.comwww.boltblue.co.ukYou may also activate the phone s screen saver in this section. The range of screen savers is wide, and you can download more from the Internet.Settings.Change various settings on the phone.Games.There are altogether 4 games on this phone.  I m sure everyone has heard about the game,  snake  Well the 3310 has the very latest version,  Snake II  There are several different mazes to choose from and I m sure this game will keep you busy on those boring bus rides. :) The 3310 also includes a brand new game for the Nokia phones,  Space Impact  which is basically an adaptation of the classic,  Space Invaders  where you have to shoot incoming baddies etc. etc. And at the end of each level, you have to defeat the bad guy. This game is loads of fun and highly addictive, but can run your battery down something chronic if you are playing this all day, like me. :) Another game on the phone is  Bantumi  which I cannot possibly explain, because I haven t figured it out yet  It seems quite confusing, so stay away from this one   My Dad loves it though, may I add.  It just really puzzles me  If anyone could explain, please do  The last game on the phone is Pairs II. A revamped version of pairs, where you have to match two cards. Can be quite fun, however, when you have played it over 1000 times, it gets a bit boring You can change several settings such as Sounds: on/off ; Lights: on/off ; Shakes (Vibrator): on/off.Calculator.Add, subtract, divide and multiply. I ve done this before   [Student warning]: do not use this function in a maths exam. You will be disqualified  :)Reminders.You can set little reminders so you don t forget those important little dates, like mother s day or even fathers day  I have never used this, which is probably the main reason that I forget everything. I really should use this function.Clock.Tick.  Tock.  Set the time and date on your phone, so you can keep up to date with things. There is also a nifty little alarm clock, to wake you up in the morning, after those late and drunken nights  I am a heavy sleeper, and this doesn t work to well with me.Profiles.There are several different profiles on the phone, which automatically set all of the tones/message alerts and such to varying settings. General is basically the standard, with normal volume ringing tones and alerts. When in a meeting, an important interview or a church, I would advise setting the profile to silent. Be sure to turn the vibrating alert of as well, as this would be a distraction. The discreet profile, just beeps once when there is an incoming call coming in. The other profiles are LOUD, my style, which you can choose your own settings and empty, (a space for another one of your own)My conclusion.This is by far one the better phones Nokia have brought out, in my opinion. It is extremely durable.  The phone is targeted to teens and trendy adults. And watch out for the vibrating alert  It s a shocker  :)     ::::5077392:2:::5311781:3:::5252354:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5373083:4:::5373083:4:::5403217:4:::5403217:4:::5414364:4:::5315353:4:::5261270:4:::5261270:4:::5298498:4:::4738:4:::4738:4:::5217254:4:::5247568:4:::5250192:4:::5106801:4:::5240143:4:::5240143:4:::5045797:4:::5013036:4:::5013036:4:::20917:4:::20917:4:::5202056:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5066322:4:::5025939:4:::5208077:4:::5020889:4:::5202843:4:::2256:4:::5151816:4:::5077388:4:::5085560:4:::5085560:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::5066721:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::6389:4:::9435:4:::5077810:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::5045874:4:::5092656:4:::1763:4:::5076471:4:::5066765:4:::5066765:4:::4881:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::5035648:4:::5019788:4:::5026044:4:::5040987:4:::5055798:4:::19851:4:::19851:4:::5018925:4:::5018925:4:::5000758:4:::5035866:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::5050930:4:::5019931:4:::5019748:4:::5018050:4:::5018050:4:::5040619:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5025695:4:::5025695:4:::5001519:4:::5001519:4:::5000594:4:::5000594:4:::20081:4:::5017833:4:::2998:4:::5027357:4:::</endperson>

19415::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::24.12.2000::::    Nokia continue to produce high quality phones, the 3310 is the next step on from the 3210. The first thing that will strike you is the knew look. The phone is much better suited fitting in your hand, and keeps a smooth design line the whole way round. Unlike the Nokia 3210 which has a very perculiar shape. Once again there is no protruding Arial from the top of the phone, which really gives it a snug fit into your pocket. The 3310 s simple menu is very easy to use, and undoubtably the best layout that I ahve ever seen. Within two presses you can find the option that you want and have it activated. The great thing thing though about this one, is the ability to download new menu features from compatibable networks. This means that when a new feature is realesed, you can be suer that your phone should be able to use it.There are 7 spaces to save your new ringtones, rather than the 3210 s feable 1. This is good news for tone lovers, because there are so many availibe today you may want to keep more than one. Voice activated dialing means that for up to 8 people you can contact them from just 1 word. ANother great feature is the ability to set different tones for who is calling you, you could have one say for business calls, and one for personal calls. The most fantastic feature though, is undoubtably the included games. There are 4 games that really make use of the 3310 s full graphic display. These include Snake 2 which is a really great seqeul to the first. A good thing about this version is that you can register with Nokia for your personal ID. And use it everytime you get a high score to be matched agaisnt people all over Europe.The new Nokia 3310 has so many new features and improvements. Nokia have really done well to create such a superb phone. Of course there are a few let downs. 1 example is the  x-press on covers  which prove to be not very expressive. They can take more than a few minutes to swap over. However you do get use to this in time and can manage to use them without too much agony. I brought this phone as my first Nokia, and would reccomend it to many new Nokia pay as you go users. But if you allready own a Nokia 3210 there is not much point in moving to the new phone, allthough you would bennifit greatly. In short Nokia have once again created a truely personal mobile that can be tailored to suit your needs.     ::::5014950:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5001374:3:::20105:4:::20105:4:::17101:4:::1704:4:::14485:4:::5000806:4:::23544:4:::5002060:4:::17253:4:::17253:4:::</endperson>

5254873::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::18.11.2003::::    The Nokia 3310 is a little bit dated now, with all the new technology and gadgets on newer mobile phones. However, I have had three of these so far, and am still using the third. (Just to make it clear it wasn t the fault of the phone that I had to replace it, more the fact that my destructive three year old sone thinks mobiles can swim  )Mobile phone prices vary a lot, and my first Nokia 3310 was bought for    120 on Orange pay as you go from Carphone Warehouse. It was a new phone at the time. My most recent Nokia 3310 was bought for    79 on Virgin from Phones4U in Stevenage.This model is a good size for handbags and pockets. My first mobile was like a house brick, so I really appreciate having a more compact and conveinient one. You can now get mobiles that are a lot smaller, but I would find these fiddly and difficult to use.FEATURESThe are different categories in the phone s menu. I will go through these in order.Phone book **********I have found that the amount of numbers that you can store varies depending on the network. On orange I could store 99 contacts, and on Virgin I can store 200. You have an option to search through your phone book, whereby you can enter the name of the person you want to call and it finds the number for you. This is a bit pointless as from the main screen you can just press down and then the first letter of the name you want and it gets you there quicker.Then you have the option to add names, eraseand edit them. You can also assign ringtones to people, so you know who is calling you. I gave poor old brother  the ringtone called  The Bufoon . He wasn t amused.Then there is the option to send b card - no this doesn t stand for birthday card, but business card. This means you can search a number to send to somebody else. Depending on the network, it normally costs the same as a standard text message.You have options on how you want to veiw the names in your phone book, whether you want name and number or just a name list. Also in these options it tells you how many contacts you have and how many more you can add.Another feature in phone book is speed dials so you can set certain numbers that you can call by just pressing one button.A really interesting feature that it has is voice tags. This is where you can press the main button and say a name, then it calls that person. It sounds cool, but personally I don t use it because you have to say the name in exactly the same way that you did when you recorded it. Might not sound to hard but believe me, you don t realise until you try. Background noise also affects it.Messages********In this option you can type text messages (SMS), receieve them and store them. You can also send picture messages. There is an option named templates which allows you to make up standard messages such as  I m at home. Please Call  to save you time on typing out a message that you would send often.You can turn on delivery reports. This informs you when your message has been delivered. I always use this, otherwise if someone doesn t reply to me I think I ve done something to upset them  When it s just that they haven t recieved my message yet.Chat****I haven t worked out how to use this yet, but I think it is similar to text messages, but you can use it if you want a long conversation with texts rather than just the odd one.Call Register*************Here you can see who you have missed calls from, recieved calls from, who you have called and the time of the call. On Virgin your phone automatically stores up to 20 in each section. You can erase these lists if you want to. You can also see you call durations and costs.Tones*****Here s the fun part.  The Phone is already preset with lots of ring tones. Examples of these being Walzing Matilda, Jingle Bells, Happy Birthday and Auld Land Syne. However you can buy ringtones for your mobile from various places, including the internet, magazine adverts and shops. Some websites give them away for free, but they tend to be of a lesser quality. You can also compose your own ringtones, and some websites tell you what keys to press to get your favourite tunes. You can set the volume of the ringtone, your incomming call alert can be turned off, you can chose your message alert tone andchoose whether or not you want keypad tones, warning tones and vibrating alert on or off.Settings********Here you have your mobile settings, where you can choose what language you want, put a welcome note on for when you turn on your phone, turn on a pincode to keep intruders out of your phonem and alter security settings.Call Divert***********Here you are given the option to divert called if you are going to be busy, or chose when to divert them, ie when off, when you dont answer, when there s no network coverage etc. The call will be diverted to your voicemail service that you can set up by calling the number provided by your network.Games*****More fun here. On the 3310 you can play four games, Snake 2, Pairs, Bantumi and Space Impact. They are quite basic, but can be quite addictive too, especially the ones with high score features.Calculator**********This speaks for itself really, but you have an exchange rate option and you can a foriegn currency converter.Reminders*********You can set reminders to let you know things like special days, or the time of your doctors appointment. The alarm goes off and what you want to be reminded about comes up on the screen.Clock*****You can set a clock so need for a watch if you carry your phone everywhere. Here you can also set the alarm, good if you don t wake up easiliy in the morning but be warned, if you dont stop the alarm it gets louder and louder, and you may be tempted to chuck it on the floor Profiles********Lastly, you can set you fone on different modes, such as silent if you dont want to hear it go off, vibrate, loud etc. You can set these yourself and name them whatever you want.You can change the face of your mobile, there are lots of different covers you can buy. This means you can personalise your phone. I prefer the one it comes with because I think it looks smart. Taking the battery can be a little difficult but you get used to it.I reccomend this phone to fisrt time mobile buyers since it is easy to navigate and quite fun too, but not state of the art. A camera feature might be nice, but I think i ll have to start saving..... or maybe Father Christmas will bring me one      ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5696348:4:::5703194:4:::5703194:4:::5690774:4:::5469307:4:::5252558:4:::5252558:4:::5326218:4:::5326218:4:::5126903:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5371098:4:::5371098:4:::5326581:4:::5326581:4:::5186837:4:::5076524:4:::5076524:4:::8689:4:::5337786:4:::5369233:4:::5369233:4:::5379241:4:::</endperson>

9444::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::06.10.2000::::    The 3310 looks like a cross between the 6110/6210/3210 and is really a successor to the 3210. It s majorly vaunted new feature is an SMS based chat function. Whilst this sounds cool, effectively is is a big con. You wouldn t use the net as a chatroom if you had to pay around 12p for each message you send. Yep that is right, using this function you are paying the cost of an SMS for each time you use it. Moreover if you fall for this then you are probably going to spend more of SMS messages than you would if you phoned the person on your mobile, to their mobile on a different network. So fathom the logic of having an SMS conversation for more than the price of a peak rate phone call...The phone itself is the usual reliable Nokia fare, although if you have a choice, opt for the 6210 ahead of this, as it is much better value, has WAP and doesn t have the stupid chat function.  The 3310 though is a great phone - new games to play and so on but if you get into the SMS chat, then you can kiss goodbye to a whole lot of cash. I can t actually slag the phone off technically, but I think the SMS chat will be the scourge of many people s mobile bills. If you can manage to live without the Chat service then by all means buy it, but if you are offered a 6210 for the similar price, then take that phone instead.     ::::23574:3:::23574:3:::20081:3:::10968:3:::10968:3:::</endperson>

22154::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::26.02.2001::::    The nokia 3310, well I purchased mine in November 2000, as an upgrade to a nokia 402, (which I have passed on to my daughter). Well, what can I say, smaller, lighter and with more features, like speed dialing, voice activated dialing, multiple text messaging, longer (460 characters) text messages, chat facility, alarm clock, reminder, up to 42 ring tones, vibrating alert, calculator and 4 games (snake 2, space impact, pairs 2 and bantumi). All this in a mobile phone that fits in the palm of you hand, or pocket with ease, and you can customize with a variety of interchangeable covers and key pads. I  8217;ve sat on it (all 13 stone of me), and dropped this phone, and it  8217;s still working perfectly, a tribute to the reliability that I  8217;ve come to expect from nokia products.     ::::5001159:2:::5018081:2:::5001498:2:::1704:3:::18192:3:::18192:3:::5012426:3:::7733:3:::5000696:3:::7813:3:::7813:3:::23544:3:::10539:4:::</endperson>

5025150::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::12.05.2002::::    I have just bought this great phone for 100 quid.  I had wanted a new phone for about 4 months as my old one was bulky and the reception was awful.  So off i trotted to my local mobile phone shop looking for my perfect phone, after about 10 minutes i found the Nokia 3310 stuck in the corner of the shop with all the older phones.  I asked the shop assistant what he thought of the phone and he said it was a good phone, but i would be better buying one(Which of course was alot more expensive than the 3310)which was a bit smaller.  After the guy giving me the smooth talk into trying to by a samsung which was 300 pounds, i decided that i would by the 3310.After getting home and unpacking the phone and charging it, whilst i was reading the manual i was amazed that the shop assistant had tryed to sell me another phone which was three times more expensize and wasn t as good as this one in my opinion.  Once i had looked through the phone menu and put all my numbers in the phone book i found the games and was playing them for about an hour when my battery started to go flat, which i was annoyed at.As i say this phone is my brain because i could never remember all the numbers i have, and it keeps me entertained when i get bored.The major problem with this phone is that you can put logos on it but you have to ring for them to be put on and they can cost up to a fiver, so i think that nokia should put like they did with the ringtones and put a logo composer onto the phone.Over all an excellant phone with the potential be the best phone on the market.       ::::5022103:2:::5022103:2:::5207597:2:::5186837:2:::5021241:2:::5066721:2:::5207600:2:::5207600:2:::6072:2:::6072:2:::5208118:2:::10901:2:::10901:2:::5036152:2:::5036152:2:::5211998:2:::23569:2:::5202944:2:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5091379:3:::5091379:3:::5202843:3:::5202792:3:::5035866:3:::1704:3:::4295:3:::4295:3:::5091531:3:::5250596:4:::</endperson>

5093416::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::30.09.2001::::    My first mobile phone s been an Ericsson T28s and in the first period i found it very good but very soon I started having problems: bad reception, bad and  short living battery, problem with the shell and so I decided to change it.I use a Nokia 3310 and it s very very good   It s light, short and It can be put in a pocket or a little bag, a thin and powerful battery (technology made giant steps in miniaturization) that doesn t leave you too soon (260 hrs in standby mode and even 5 hours of conversation  using the right battery), a good reception even in bad conditions (my T28s had problems even open air ), a scrolling and animated menu very speedy and easy to use (T28 s menu is very slow    ) and T9 system to send messages very easy to use  T9 is very useful but sometimes didn t suggest the words you want but obviously you can exclude it.  Assign tone allows you to specify a specific ring tone for each person in your phone book, this way you know immediately who are calling you.Obviously you can send SMS (Short Message Service), which is actually, not that short this time, The Nokia 3310 allows your text messages to be 459 characters long, instead of the 160 characters normally sendable but you pay for 3 messages  You have a calculator and a reminder where to put date and a little message to remind you birthdays, coffee talks, meetings and so on...There is a clock and you can change the date / time, set an alarm clock, also has countdown and stopwatch features. If you must do long travels you can play games: SNAKE 2, PAIRS 2, SPACE IMPACT and BANTUMI  Use BSI 3310 to put a sim between the shell and battery and the vibracall is fundamental if you don t want to disturb your  neighbours when you study in a library or during a meeting  Nokia is maybe the best company in this period and 3310 is a very good present for birthdays or Christmas       ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5202843:4:::5040619:4:::5040957:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5045874:4:::5085416:4:::5027058:4:::5085848:4:::5085848:4:::3728:4:::3728:4:::5077810:4:::5081053:4:::5081053:4:::5025810:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::</endperson>

5012563::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::27.01.2001::::    It was time to buy a new phone as my previous phone was on its last legs.I ha da choice of to that were in my budget a T20 or a 3310 i started to look around all the mobile phone shops in my area,I came home with pages and pages of info on handsets and networks.After spending a few hours looking at all these phones i realised the 3310e was for me.It offered all the functions that i needed eg   .vibrating alert  .4 addictive games  .4.5 hors talktime  .5.5 hors standby time  .texting service  .changable front and back covers  .calculator  .curency converter  .picture text messenging  .7 composable ringtones  If your fashion concious this is the phone for you as it looks smart  all thanks to its size it fitts easily in any pocket as it only meashures 113x48x21 mm.   I payed    99.99 fora 3310e on the orange just talk network in December of 2000.I now belive that all mobile phones have gone up in price and the 3310 is now    129.99.I think these phones are well worth the money if you loook after them.I did not really care for mines as i thought it was a sturdy little thing which recently i found out it wansnt,mine was acciedently dropped down the stairs and the ringing tone sensor was broken so it never rang just vibrated .  I decided i was going to go for the the Orange Just talk network as the call costs suited me.   I would reccommend these phones to buisness users only as the range of features goes on forever.I would not reccommend these phones to children as childrens phones tend to get knocked about a little.For children i would reccommend the 5110 or 3210 as they have enough featuers to keep them happy eg games etc,They also stand to a lot of genral knocks and bashes                    ::::5001519:1:::5001519:1:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5080896:3:::5000696:3:::23074:3:::5040677:4:::5040677:4:::5035866:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5076622:4:::5018043:4:::5018043:4:::</endperson>

5066672::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::10.07.2001::::    I really like my new Nokia 3310.  It is Chic, Practical, Sturdy and Easy to use.It is one of the best phones for personalising, due to the amount of logos (screen savers) and ringtones it can handle.  Check the Club Nokia website for freebies when you register.The menu s are so easy to follow that my mother can use it ( she is a complete technophobe ) and dialling with the voice activation is a breeze.  When I first got the phone I spent an hour checking out the handbook, but to be honest, the menu is easier to follow than the book.Texting is fun with the predictive text messaging feature ( it can be switched to normal very easily )  and quick too.  I have a 020 so picture messaging is not supported, but that s ok. I like the message reports, they tell you when the message was delivered, handy if you need to contact someone urgently.  You can tell if their phone is off or out of signal because it shows as a pending message not a sent one.I have never had the need to use the chat facility, but I am sure it s a godsend to some users, it really speeds things up.The games have been updated a little, although I am not very good at them, I enjoy a quick round with the snake every now and again. Had a go at Space Impact and just crashed   burned, so we ll forget that.  Have not got a clue about how to play Bantumi but I m sure someone will teach me. Pairs is much the same as ever, a bit on the quiet side.I find the currency converter very good, it took a while to get the hang of, but it is useful as is the calculator.One of the features which I like best is the Reminders, it s great for appointments and Birthdays.  The phone just sends a message at the time and date you specify to tell you to remember the appointment.The Nokia 3310 comes free with most contracts now or it can be bought on all the pre-pay networks for just over a hundred pounds,  well worth the money.I have dropped it on a few occasions and it just bounces.  The battery life is good if you don t have the vibrate alert on all the time, although it takes a while to charge ( I usually leave it on overnight ).All in all it is a great phone and it s so easy to put in your bag ( with the keylock on of course) or your pocket.  I would heartily recommend it.     ::::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::5066539:3:::5066539:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5035704:4:::5035704:4:::19851:4:::19851:4:::5035982:4:::5035866:4:::17410:4:::17410:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::5025695:4:::5025695:4:::5020168:4:::5027357:4:::5066537:4:::5040619:4:::5066417:4:::5066417:4:::</endperson>

5018728::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::11.03.2001::::    I got this phone on BT pay as you go - and I am amazed.The sleek slim body is lightweight and provides a good basis from which to start.  A seemingly smaller version of the Nokia 3210, this phone opens up a lot more once you get inside.The first area to look at is the calls.  You can speed dial, voice dial, manual dial or pretty much any other dial you like really.  I prefer the speed dial as I have relatively few people to call but I call the same ones a lot.  Those amongst you who like to show off will no doubt stand in town and speak into the phone just to show off (just dont say 999 ).  It s a shame the voice dial still requires a few keys in order to work really, it spoils it.  It probably takes just as much effort to key in the voice dial mode, then get close enough so the phone can pick up what your saying, then dial another key to accept what you said than it is to just type - thats my view anyway.Next is the second most important thing (although to teens, this is the bit you read ) - SMS.  The available text messaging size is 420 letters, but dont be fooled into thinking this is as simple as it seems.  The more letters you write, the more you pay for.  You will be charged 10p for the first message, 20p if you go over 240 letters etc... so be warned to watch out for this.  The messages can contain any number of many amazing little gizmo s too - like pictures and moving messages too.  I recieved one message of a moving dog (I have ruder ones it s best not to mention :)), all of which move without you having to toucha key.  Good eh?.Now, the text messaging is good, so onto the next most important  teen  feature, the games.  You get the basic old favourite, Snakes.  The actual version on here though comes with a twist, oh and its called snakes 2.  You can go through walls and can get small animals to eat after every 5  balls of food  to help you along the way.  The amazing thing here though, Nokia will record your top scores and sometimes even give prizes away - and that service is FREE  (this applies to ALL GAMES).  The other games included are Bantsumi (a weird coin in the hand game - didn t really understand it myself but it does attract some people), Pairs (the old obvious card game but a really poorly done version, hardly going to have you addicted ) and then comes my favourite, space impact.  This is a sideways scrolling game worth a look if you want to see how to play arcade games on a phone.That done, now onto things like the call registry and so forth.  Those of you with secrets will be pleased to know you can delete any of the numbers in your last caller or missed numbers lists.  For the rest of us with a clearer concience its convenient to have the last 10 callers and numbers dialled available without going through loads of menu s - and missed callers too.  The menu s themselves are easy to use, only those lacking a solo braincell will struggle here (hey, my 6 year old sister went in there and told me the last 3 numbers I called ).  For those who wish to keep their kids out, you get the normal password and keys locked capabilities.  This is handy to stop you from dialing numbers when the phone is in your pocket and you walk along blissfully unaware of the encroaching phone bill.It s interesting to note the lack of WAP ability on this phone, but then I dont want that anyway.  It is annoying trying to access the internet through such a small screen anyway, I have my computer for that.  It s no advantage to send free texts from the net anyway when you spend 10 mins trying to get online in the first place.  Other than that, I would stick my head on the blocks and say this is the best phone out, certainly from Nokia.  Unless you are after a WAP phone specifically, get this one.  Just watch out for the hefty    99.99 price tag (can be cheaper in some places, it is coming down ).  It is free on contract in many places though, take a look if you can pass the credit checks they put on you  :)     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5019302:4:::5018755:4:::5014101:4:::18033:4:::18033:4:::5001532:4:::5014428:4:::</endperson>

5013383::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::05.02.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is a stylish, slinky phone which easily beats the 3210 as the Nokia budget phone. Many new features are brilliant on the 3310 and with the phone being free or very cheap on the market the advantages for the smaller phone are aplenty.The most addictive and favourite function on the phone remains the Games area. This has taken somewhat of a face lift on the 3310. Easily the best game has to be Space Impact which enables you to blast through a galaxy of meteors and aliens. The game is surprisingly fluent and although it is relatively short you won t stop playing it once you have completed it. The old classic Snake is back but this time you have a choice of 5 funky mazes which reaqlly do sort out the rookies from the experts. The snake is faster this time too which adds another element of skill.Other new functions such as the Chat function are good as this allows an e-mail style chat on your phone between two people without having to go out and write a new message everytime. Profiles allows you to set your own settings several times which means it doesn t take ages to switch ring tones or screensavers. Aaa, the cool new screensavers are quite good actually with a whole range of funky little pics. Also, there is space to save 7 new ringtones which eliminates the problem on the 3310 of erasing your old tune every time you send a new one. The reception on the phone is excellent as I have never been without coverage in the past 3 months.Overall, the 3310, has overtaken the 3210 as the new fashion Nokia item.     ::::5016186:3:::18021:3:::18021:3:::5003761:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::</endperson>

10307::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::11.02.2001::::    Nokia 3310 - wow, what a phoneVery small and compact, light durable, even sexy some may say. Yes i do like it, very much.Easy to use, despite the tiny keys, lots of features, especially good if you are in to texting as it has predictive typing(which can be switched off), picture messaging, group sending options.  It has 240 hours of standby time and that alone takes some beating. There are games, an alarm clock, stopwatch, a calculator.  It has lots of security features, language can be changed, you can create your own welocome note and have your own screen saver.  You can use voice activated dialling, assign different tones to different phone numbersBeing a nokia, you also have the option of chosing a new ring tone or screen saver from the many companies you see advertised these days.  You can also compose your own ring tone.  You can chose to divert all calls or calls from specific numbers you can personalise your voice mailbox.The list of features and its abilities appear endless, I still have not fully explored my new phone but if, like nearly everyone else these days, you are a sad yuppie mobile phone owner who cannot live without means of communication, then the Nokia 3310 is for you.  Go to www.club.nokia.com and see for yourself.     ::::5025810:2:::7733:3:::5371:3:::5371:3:::17308:3:::17308:3:::</endperson>

22178::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::06.04.2001::::    New Nokias arrive more often than buses in this part of the world, and though reasonably new the Nokia 3310 is already a common sight on the street.The soap bar shape with built is antenna is solid and more masculine looking than the more expensive Nokia 8210 or 8850.  The phone has similair features to the 3210 in a slightly smaller overall size - and manages to add a stopwatch, vibrate alert and voice activated dialling - all restricted until recently to much pricier Nokias.The 3310 is widely available free of charge on contract and is now on several networks on pay as you talk style schemes.The clip on covers allow you to personalise this popular phone.     ::::5000858:2:::5000858:2:::23249:2:::23249:2:::7733:2:::20081:2:::17410:2:::17410:2:::5017028:2:::5017028:2:::5020893:2:::23074:2:::16615:3:::</endperson>

12281::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::23.01.2001::::    This phone is one of the long list I have owned in my time as a mobile phone hunter. I had this phone for two months before it was released in this country and found it to have great basic needs of a mobile phone. I really didnt think I d be so impressed by yet another dinky Nokia phone, but I was quite overwellmed by the attractive features this phone had for the quite cheap price it was going for. The phone has much the same keys and buttons to the different parts of it s menu or map as all most new Nokia phones do which made it easier to use as I ve used many Nokia s already. It also has 4 great games of which Space Impact is excellent      ::::6588863:1:::5001205:1:::5001205:1:::5002576:2:::18021:3:::18021:3:::</endperson>

5000758::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::12.12.2000::::    I think this phone is quite good, it is smaller than the 3210 and in a little bit different design.  It is available on a range of networks, this gives you the opportunity to choose.  It has all the standard feature of the nokia 3210 but it has voice activated dialing which can be useful.  It has changeable express on covers this is good so you can personlise your phone.  It costs around    120 maybe cheaper and has a very long stanby time and a long talk time.  Overall it looks like a good product.     ::::5001343:2:::17253:2:::17253:2:::5002383:4:::</endperson>

2698::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::11.01.2001::::    My friend has bought herself a Nokia 3310, and I feel jealous, I want one, and am going to purchase myself one. Before I thought a mobile phone was effective if you could make one phone call to another at a reasonable price, but now I feel that the features that a phone has are also very important.The Nokia phone my friend has so good one, I love games on the mobile, and become quickly very addicted to one, so how great is this on some of the games you get a little warning when you are about to lose a life. When we travel together, I often make sure she has charged her mobile up so I can play the games on it. You can download favourite songs from sites, and when I phone her up, she has at the moment downloaded Walking away, so when the answer machine is one, I don  8217;t feel frustrated I just have a quick listen and then put the phone down. You can send extra long text messages, and if you like sending them you will love the phone. This sounds like my kind of phone, does it sound like yours?.  I have missed features out, but there are more. This is smart little phone sure to keep you busy.     ::::23544:2:::5002069:3:::5002066:3:::15714:3:::5001623:3:::22607:3:::16725:4:::5001880:4:::</endperson>

5001050::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::12.01.2001::::    My mum got one of those for Christmas; and a great value phone it is too.For anyone who has a Nokia 3210, it s basically the same phone but more compact and with a few extra features. The most impressive of these is voice activation, where you record your set of names directly into the voice via speech, and then can call any number you have put in by speaking it. It s a minor touch, but a nice addition nonetheless.Other new introductions include the lethally addictive Snake 2, and a personal organiser. Not enough changes to upgrade if you have a 3210, but still a decent buy if you need a new phone.     ::::13861:2:::13861:2:::5000883:3:::5001159:4:::</endperson>

6811202::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::01.11.2010::::    Ahhh the trusty Nokia 3310... I ve had this phone for around 10 years now and it has seen me through some trying times... Over recent years I ve owned all the  latest phones  and quite a few of them have broken on me due to water damage / being dropped / not being made well enough. About 12 months ago I reverted back to the Nokia 3310, after a misfortunate event with my latest all singing, all dancing phone. I was only using the Nokia 3310 of for a matter of weeks (on this occasion), but little did I know, a few months down the line, I was going to be reminded of just how reliable the 3310 is... Now let s picture the scene... Christmas has just past, I ve been staying with my mum in West Yorkshire and I decide to drive back home to Manchester... the weather is treacherous, my car seems to be having difficulties climbing hills, but I persevere, hoping that my car will start to pick up speed. But as I reach the M62 - a motorway that takes you over Saddleworth Moor - my car is only managing 20mph. I have no choice, I have to pull over, it s freezing, there s a blizzard going on outside, so what do I do? I get out my all singing, all dancing Samsung phone so that I can call for help, I get it out of my bag and I happen to glance at the battery -  quot;Oh *   , it s almost dead. quot; At this point I start to panic... do I use my remaining battery to call recovery? My mum? My OH? I don t know what to do... then I suddenly remember  quot;That Nokia 3310 might still be in my handbag. quot; After rooting through a pile of rubbish (I carry everything around with me), I find the phone... and even though I haven t used it in a good couple of months, it has a full battery, HALLALUAH... I can t tell you how relieved I am  Now that story (which is entirely true by the way) proves what a lot of us have always known - the Nokia 3310 has a great battery life, it s reliable and even though it s been on the market for over a decade, it still works perfectly (even if you ve accidently thrown it on the floor a gazillion times). The phone menu is very simple - and you can scroll through a list of functions, including your phone book, your text messages, a calculator and a list of simple - including Snake (the original and ultimate mobile phone game). You can t access the internet on the 3310, because these phones came before mobile internet technology became the norm. But perhaps this explains why it has such a strong battery and it doesn t break every five minutes? These 3310 comes with a black plastic charger and I have found that many different Nokia chargers fit into the phone, which is really handy. My 3310 seems to accept SIM cards from different networks, including O2 and Orange, so various members of the family have borrowed it on a number of occasions. I can t rave about this phone enough, despite the fact that I ve owned umpteen different phones since I originally purchased the 3310, it s the one phone that I keep coming back to and I highly recommend it as a  back up  phone. Check out eBay to pick up your very own 3310.

6778641::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::05.09.2009::::    Ooooh  Nokia3310, the good old times of nostalgia and the joys of discovering text messages  This was my very first phone, and the best phone I ever used  Nokia 3310 will also remain as the most solid and reliable mobile phone ever. Mine fell in a large mug of juice and was working again after just a few hours of hair dying it. Specifications While the specifications of this phone cannot be compared to the latest one we have now, there are certain endearing aspects and specifications to the phone: *Display: Monochrome graphic, Softkey, Screensaver, Welcome message *Sound: Vibration, 37 ringtones *Memory: Sim Only, 8 dialed, received and miss calls stored *No Card Slot *No Camera (sounds antique doesn t it?) *SMS *Clock *Alarm *Games: Snakes, Space Impact, Bantumi, Pairs *Talk Time: Anything from 2hours30 minutes to 4hours30minutes (depending on the lifetime and condition of your battery) (note: Source: Nokia website) However, as great and solid as that phone might be, and as much as I love it, I must admit that it is no longer practical for our lifestyle and needs. It is quite heavy, hence quite different from the usual light and tiny mobile phones we all carry nowadays. In addition, the lack of WAP and features is most certainly a problematic aspect for many. It is the sort of phone that one would want merely for texting or calling other people, without wanting to appear  quot;in quot; or fashionable. I would personally not buy this phone today because I love playing high-quality graphic games on mobile phones. But this mobile has become quite cheap nowadays, so if you believe it will suit your needs, then go ahead and buy it. In any case, I bet that this will become a valuable antique in a decade so you might just make a fortune out of it  Thanks for reading  Also posted on dooyoo     ::::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5482024:3:::5482024:3:::6796407:3:::6145850:3:::6044343:3:::6044343:3:::6781956:3:::5953084:3:::5953084:3:::6795012:4:::5247778:4:::5247778:4:::</endperson>

5203100::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::26.03.2002::::    MENU ----- 1:PHONE BOOK-the phone book is where you store all phone numbers in. The options here are search, where you type in a letter and then all the numbers beginning with that letter come up (e.g T-thomas,tracey). Add name is quite obvious, this is where you add people into your phone book. Erase, this is where if you don t want a number anymore you erase it. Edit, this is where if you have made a mistake, you change it with this option. Assign tone, this option is for anyone that wants all the people in their phone book to have a specific ring so they know who is calling, I just put it on default which means the ringtone you choose will work for them all. Send b card is send business card, if you want anyone to know your number or anyone else s you send this. If you go to options you can change the way your phone book is set out, you have the choices, name list, name, number, large font. If you go to memory status, you can see how many spaces have been taken up and how many are left for phone numbers. There is another option speed dials, this means if you re in a hurry save a number you want onto a number key, like 1 or 2 etc. then you just press 2 if you want to phone that person you saved there, it s easier to use. Voice tags are when you say the persons name in the phone book, (e.g sarah) you say that name and then when you want to call them just press the key and say sarah and it will call them. Info numbers has the numbers for traffic and travel, leisure, financial and help, also services. 2:MESSAGES-this section is for text messages it has the options to write messages, this has all different icons and symbols to write with. There is your inbox where all received text messages are kept. Your outbox is for all messages that couldn t be sent. Picture messages these are good there are 14 stored into your phone which you can send people. You get templates which are messages already written that you can send if you can t be bothered to write, they are usual messages like  please call . There is a smiley face option too which you can attach the smileys to text messages. The other 2 options are message settings and voicemail number, this number is what you call up when you have a new voice message, it s just the same as an answering mahine but on your mobile, I think it s great. The last option is service command editor. 3:CHAT-This is where you pick a friend and have a chat name and then send them a message and they reply. 4:CALL REGISTER-Missed calls, this option only works if you miss a call when your phone is on. Received calls, this is all the calls you have received and not missed. Dialled numbers, this is the last 20 numbers you have dialled. Erase recent call lists, this is if you want to delete your received, dialled or missed call lists. Show call duration, this is your last call duration, all calls  duration, recieved calls  duration, and dialled calls  duration, there is an option where you can clear the timers. Prepaid drecit, this is to tell you how much credit you have. 5:TONES-ringing tone, this is where you look through your tones list and choose the one you want to ring when someone calls. Ringing volume this is how loud you want your ring to be. Incoming call alert, this is what you wnat to happen when someone rings, you can either choose ringing, ascending, ring once, beep once, or off. Composer, this is where you can make up your own ringtones, also you can download tones from the internet onto your phone. Message alert tone, there are 5 optinos you can have, standard, special or beep once. There is the option keypad tones and warning tones. You can have vibrating alerts this is when your phone moves when it rings. Screensaver is another option. 6:SETTINGS-Call settings, this is where you put things like speed dialling on or off. You can have call waiting and automatic redial on or off. Phone settings, this is for changing the language and putting on a welcome note. You can change security settings like access codes and pin code request. 7:CALL DIVERT-this is just about diverting calls and things like that. 8:GAMES-This is my favourite part of my phone. There is snake 2, this is the follow up to snake but it s better you can change the mazes and the level to suit your standard. Space Impact is a sort of computer game thing, with things coming near you which you have to shoot. Bantumi is a sort of gambling game and pairs 2 is a game of pairs. In the settings you can put sound on or off and shakes and lights. You get high scores for them all which is good, I like the noise when you get a new high score. 9:CALCULATOR-This is obviously for adding subtracting and multiplying things, just getting answers to sums. 10:REMINDERS-this is to write things you want remembered, incase you forget. 11:CLOCK-you can get your alarm clock, which is good , clock settings to change the time if it s wrong or if it needs to be put back and hour or forward. You can have date settings and a stopwatch and countdown timer, quite a lot for a phone. 12:PROFILES-this is to change your phone from incoming calls and messages being silent, discreet, loud or general, I use general. I think after all that, it shows this is a brilliant phone, it has everything on it so what more would you want, I haven t regretted buying it. This phone is differently priced depending if you re getting pay as u go or monthly line rental phone. I like the new Nokia models because you don t have to worry about your phone being the same as anyone else s with different Fascia s      ::::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202751:4:::5202751:4:::5092666:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::5091379:4:::5091379:4:::21963:4:::9435:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5202678:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::5203171:4:::5203171:4:::5202792:4:::5041033:4:::5041033:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::19266:4:::</endperson>

5078395::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::05.08.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 has been discussed a lot since it came out. Here s what I make of it: If you are getting this phone on a contract basis, you should get the handset free. A great feature on this phone is that you can send both standard and extra long text messages, up to three in one go, although it probably does charge you that much extra. You can also send picture messages.You can also send smileys to friends, depending on whether their phones can receive them. There s a choice of 5 message alert tones and a vibrator alert too. The phone book has extra memory with 150 spaces for names and numbers. I have found this extremely helpful to store (sometimes useless) information. You have the option to assign different ring tones to different people stored in the book The phone has a call register( like the 3210), where it saves the last 10 missed, dialled and received numbers. You can save these numbers, erase individual ones, or erase all call lists in one go. This is a useful function if you are forever forgetting numbers (like me ). You get the annoying ringtones, however you can add 7 (yes 7  ) of your own either off the internet or the composer. Yay   Snake 2, an advance on snake is on this phone. It is pretty addictive like the original. You have the usual nokia functions including a calculator and has a foreign/domestic exchange feature on it. You can add reminder facilities and these will work whether the phone is on or off, providing you have the phone set correctly. You also have the cool choice to set screen savers on the phone. You can also personalise your phone by getting the changeable covers. It s great for vain people who want their phones to complement their outfits (who me?  no way ). Current owners of the 3310 may feel cheated that Nokia released the wap-enabled 3330 so soon. There is no offer for an upgrade either which seems a bit unfair.Quite small and sophisticated this phone is basically an update of the 3210. It is popular due to the extra memory and other special features available. It may not be for people who don t want the same phone as everyone else.     ::::5022103:3:::5022103:3:::5025810:3:::6825635:4:::6825635:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202843:4:::5040914:4:::5040914:4:::5003707:4:::5066496:4:::8421:4:::8421:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::5027357:4:::5035866:4:::5020889:4:::5055819:4:::5046089:4:::1763:4:::4881:4:::6389:4:::5040824:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::</endperson>

5201878::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::21.09.2002::::    I am about to share one of the most embarrassing moments of my recent life with you.  Please don   t be tempted to laugh because the mental scars that I have picked up due to this experience will never totally go away and I may well be affected by it for the rest of my laugh until I   m in my grave.  Oh shut up John you idiot just tell the good people about it - they   re all desperate to know.  Look at them they   re hanging on the edge of their seats with their tongues hanging out at the prospect of what I could possibly have done to myself.  OK - here goes.Our story starts with the buying of my new mobile phone - A Nokia 3310 connected to Vodaphone.  I was more than pleased with the phone considering the last phone I had was a Motorola that was bigger than an encyclopedia.  The phone and I spent three months together happily communicating with our friends and family when the inevitable happened.  I started to get curious.  I began to wonder about the security codes.  I scoured my instruction manuals - all seven of them endlessly but I couldn   t find a single sentence or bullet point about security codes and pin numbers.  This began to annoy me and in the end I stupidly tried to guess the number.  I knew from previous experience that the Pin number and security codes on a mobile phone are set to an easy to remember number in the factory.  On my previous phone it was five zeroes for the PIN and 1234 for the security code so I ventured forth, confident in the knowledge that I was about to crack the case.  Not so.  I entered the five zeroes for the PIN to no avail, then I entered 12345 - still no cigar.  Finally I decided to try to hit random numbers to see if that worked.  Looking back it was something that I didn   t need to do, I had no previous inclination of doing, something that I now regret doing and will never do again.  However there was no way in the world that I wasn   t going to do it in that moment of madness.  Anyway the SIM card was blocked.  I had entered the Pin wrong three times and the SIM card had blocked.  DOH   It was asking me to enter a PUK code to unblock the SIM.  No worries.  I   d heard about this process before - you have to phone up the network provider (Vodafone) customer service line and they give you the code.  Fine                        Not fine.For some strange reason my mind just ceased to work that day and whatever stupidity I had already shown was about to look intelligent next to what I was about to do next.I can explain my logic.  I thought the damage had been done, that there was nothing I could possibly do to mess the phone up any more.  How very wrong I was.  I started hitting numbers at random to try to guess the PUK code.  I did it about 10 times and nothing happened.  It was still asking for the PUK code.  Then in what I saw as a moment of destiny my head was filled with a number, which I entered.  Time seemed to slow down as I waited in anticipation for the phone   s reaction.  There were two beeps and I watched in horror as the phone gave me two words:  SIM REJECTED.I don   t know what I was expecting but it certainly wasn   t that.  I got the yellow pages out and phoned the customer service line at once.  The well-spoken man on the other end of the line was very helpful in telling me that I had permanently blocked my SIM card and would have to spend    25 on a new one.  Still I learnt my lesson.  I now know not to go entering numbers into a phone when you haven   t got a clue what you   re doing.  I just hope that others can learn from my mistakes.THE RATINGS DON T REALLY APPLY TO THIS OPINION.     ::::5403217:3:::5403217:3:::5399756:3:::5092353:3:::5092353:3:::5066097:3:::5066097:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5240190:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5076524:3:::5076524:3:::2998:3:::5116798:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5207600:3:::5207600:3:::5013640:3:::5013640:3:::3343:3:::3343:3:::1420:3:::1420:3:::5759803:4:::5186828:4:::5186828:4:::5307399:4:::5307399:4:::5301384:4:::5191901:4:::5191916:4:::5191916:4:::5247121:4:::5241326:4:::5241326:4:::</endperson>

19093::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::31.08.2002::::    We   ve just swapped over our mobile phone contract at work from Orange to Vodafone on the basis of getting a far better financial package, but what it has also meant is a mass changeover of handsets and a whole new slew of the trendy little buggers snaking their way across the organisation and everyone having to get used to the new brute in their pocket (OO-ERR).I swear I   ll come back to the subject in hand (which is Nokia 3310 by the way, because that   s the brand new handset I got), but first I need to tell you a little anecdote about the old handsets   We were going to chuck them all out because there didn   t seem to be any reasonable way of getting any money for them, but lo and behold every cloud has a silver lining.  I got told that you could get a new SIM card and you   d be up and running straight away.  I tried a couple of old SIM cards in them that we   d had hanging around, but they wouldn   t work, and we soon found out that because these were Orange handsets, they   d only take Orange SIM cards.Anyway, Mrs D checked out on the net and found that you could probably get an Orange SIM card for around thirty notes.  We rang up Woolworths in St Annes to see if they   d got any.  They hadn   t but they told us that Radio Shack had and that they were only a couple of days away.  Great.When we got there, we found that they sold pay as you go Orange SIM cards for just eighteen quid, and we were delighted.  He also told us that he   d take all the old Nokia handsets off us for a fiver each, by the way.Anyway, all you needed to do was ring up 450 and register the SIM card and you were up and running.  Wonderful, a (virtually) brand new phone for just 18 quid, what a dream   The dave27-ettes are chasing us like mad for some more now   Anyway, back to the Nokias   The Nokia has always had the well deserved reputation round my way of being the perfect handset and the new 3310 is certainly up to standard.  It   s trendily petite and comes in some very restrained colours, although you know you can get some snazzy snap on covers if you   re of a mind.  I abhor them and go for much more conservative style, but everyone to their taste.  The only problem is that it   s a real bugger to get the back off the Nokia, so changing battery or SIM card is a bit of a trial     oh well.Anyway, in most respects the Nokia is a pretty standard mobile, robust and well put together and quite sensibly set up     although it has got that bloody irritating predictive dictionary function installed which I always find a real pain and totally illogical, but that   s just me.The menu functions break down into the following areas:Phone book     a real boon as long as you use it properly, but a real pain when you lose a card, or have to set up again.Messages     dig this in the instruction book    You can write and send multi-part text messages of almost up to three ordinary text messages in length      What on earth does that bloody mean?Chat (for text messaging battles)Call register     for missed calls, received calls, dialled numbers, etc.Tones (aaarrrgh  Again subtlety has always been my aim here)     you get the standard range, plus the God awful Composer function.Settings     for Calls, Phone and SecurityCall divert     to voice mailbox or some other phone numberGames     Snake II, Space Impact, Bantumi, Pairs II     these just hurt my bloody eyes and make them tired I   m afraid.CalculatorRemindersClockProfileSIM services     read about these in the literature     I got bored after Games.The Nokia 3310 is certainly a bloody good mobile phone     but exactly how much you   ll like it probably really does depend on your attitudes to the ubiquitous mobile.  I   m not a great fan, but they   re a bit of a necessary evil in this day and age, and Nokia have certainly got the market pretty much to themselves these days.  Ericsson have got some pretty strong offerings, although the people in my organisation have never really favoured them, while the NECs are just plain abysmal.  My Good Samaritan in Radio Shack refused point blank to give me any money back on them, I can tell you.Oh, by the way, try avoiding setting screen savers with your Nokia, they   re naff looking and the devil   s own job to ditch        ::::5301118:3:::5309724:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5286554:4:::5262580:4:::5247608:4:::5091695:4:::5245114:4:::5026862:4:::5026862:4:::5096829:4:::5078958:4:::5078958:4:::5080896:4:::18116:4:::5238961:4:::5238961:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5208276:4:::5208276:4:::5077810:4:::5013036:4:::5013036:4:::5241326:4:::5241326:4:::5202512:4:::5207600:4:::5207600:4:::5212075:4:::2854:4:::2854:4:::5202843:4:::5212054:4:::5212054:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5041033:4:::5041033:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::16949:4:::16949:4:::10438:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5035866:4:::5096981:4:::5096981:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5208379:4:::5207765:4:::5207765:4:::</endperson>

17253::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::14.12.2000::::    UPDATED OPINION - 15/01/2001Let me tell you about this great phone, how you can get one for free comes later.This is one of NOKIA s latest mobiles and it is packed full of features. Similar in appearance to their 3210 model this phone is certainly classed as a fashion accessory. It is sleek slim and relatively small and yes, you can change the covers, an all too important feature these days particularly with the youngsters.So what are the features I hear you cry, it is probably easier to list what you don t get but I won t bore you with that.You get the obligatory 50 or so ring tones plus the ability to program in 8 of your own. You have all the usual address book features, text messaging and e-mail facilities. There are 4 screensaver pictures you can deploy as well as picture messaging facilities.For the games hungry there are several games to play, snake2, space Raiders plus others. Dialling is made easy to with the Voice Dialling Feature. New ring tones, screensavers and pictures can be sent to the phone from the internet or can be requested from several other sources, at a cost. Another feature so important to the fashion aware teenager.This is a truely cracking little phone made even better by the fact that with such fierce competition in the market place a lot of companies are giving this phone away. Yes 100  free. There is a catch though as for a free phone you need to sign up for a years contract and it will cost you any where between    10.99 and    14.99 per month line rental.I took up an offer for this phone from the Carephone Warehouse in November 2000 and got not just the phone but all these other goodies too:Free connection to BTCellnet My Time Net 200 (worth    35) Free 200 minutes of off-peak calls every month Free Buzz Lightyear toy (worth    34.99) Free Portable CD player (worth    49.99) Free Skate Scooter (worth    99.99) Free ringtone scratchcard with 4 ringtones (worth    9.99) Free 3 year warranty Free deliverySo shop around and look out for the amazing offers that are to be found and you too could get hands on, on one of these great little phones.     ::::2815:1:::2815:1:::5002080:1:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5078992:3:::5078992:3:::5001159:3:::5000051:3:::5000051:3:::23745:3:::23745:3:::5026664:4:::5026664:4:::5019215:4:::20081:4:::5016270:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::10539:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::23544:4:::2698:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::9435:4:::24:4:::5000036:4:::5000036:4:::19567:4:::17503:4:::5000758:4:::17769:4:::5001156:4:::23227:4:::17494:4:::13861:4:::13861:4:::</endperson>

6690366::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::21.11.2008::::    I had to review this phone as it was my first ever phone and without question the best phone I have every had so far. Ok I know there are people that will read this review and say its old and tacky and ok maybe no one right now has it, but its one of the most popular phones of all time and for good reason. When I got it back in 2003 it had everything I needed from a phone, which is where some of these modern phones are going wrong and overloading the phone with features. Let me make it clear that it does the basics, but no other phone can do the basics as well as this phone. Also not to forget its customability with the ever changing covers available so you can make it suit your needs, now what phone released these days can change its appearance like that.? Very few if any is the answer. I must have dropped this phone a 100 times in that number of days and it does not create any damage the phone which is amazing. Unfortunately in this day and age there are people that are technho freaks with mobile phones and want one with like a 10megapixel camera and all the bells and whistles. Im sure everyone has friends like this, I know I do, but these friends are forgetting that at the end of the day it is just a mobile phone. This phone gives you the feeling of reliability and does the main things you want from a phone which is to make calls and send text messages and does these things with no fuss. Just before I finish this review I need to talk about one more features on this phone.The feature I will mention is the game Snake. Every single person who has had a nokia has played snake and I think it definetily left its mark as one of the best addictive mobile games ever. I must have spent countless hours playing this game and wasting game, but I just wanted to keep beating my high score. So the three things I wanted from a phone was calls, texts and snake and I got them all with this classical phone.To conclude this is the most reliable phone made and if any one is looking for a simple, reliable phone, then even in this day and age look no further than the nokia 3310.     ::::6439681:2:::6439681:2:::6044343:3:::6044343:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::6666536:3:::6666536:3:::5837129:3:::</endperson>

5022522::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::20::::helpful::::07.04.2001::::    Much hype surrounded the 3310 s release, as it was a follow on for the 3210, and highly awaited. As with some many things though, the hype has spoiled the product, and it is my opinion that Nokia have made a style blunder, although nobody seems to care, as sales have sky rocketed. It s my opinion that the fones look is crap - I m not talking about it s actual features within the fone mind. People will obviously disagree, and I m not stopping them. For starters, the buttons are very messed up, they stick out and feel just horrible, and often lead to you missing pressing one of them, as they stick out so much. They should be like the 3210 s, easy to press. Secondly, what is with the huge power on button at the top of the fone? Only one side of it actually presses down, so whats with the other side? Finally, the back cover of the fone has an annoying little ridge that comes from the bottom and comes across the top. It is very annoying, believe me. I m not bad mouthing the features, as they are great. It s the style Nokia have got it wrong with, and at    100 in most shops now, I d rather have a trustly 3210.      ::::23574:2:::23574:2:::5077305:2:::23544:3:::5019432:3:::23249:3:::23249:3:::5000858:3:::5000858:3:::</endperson>

5023507::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::12.04.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is the BEST pay as u go Nokia phone available. It is small, modern and very stylish. It was made as a newer more modern version of the 3210 and it lived up to the standards everyone expected. It has more better features than the 3210, for example you can now store 7 ringtones of your own choice, better games like Snake 2 and Space impact, and there is a reminders section so that u can store quick reminders on ur fone so u dont have to look for a pen and paper. The buttons on the fone are very easy to press and are more spaced out than on the 3210 so there is no having to press harder to get to the letter or number you want. There is also more picture messages and the ability to have a screen saver to appear after a certain time so that the screen of the fone looks more attractive. There is one Gr8 feature that the 3310 has which the 3210 doesnt- Vibration. This is gr8 if u need ur fone on silent or if u want to use if for sum other  personal uses  but i dont wanna go into that. Well if ur going to go out and buy a fone and u cant decide out of the 3210 and the 3310, i advise u to get the 3310. The 3210 may b cheaper but u wont b as satisfied as if u got the 3310.     ::::23544:3:::5020168:3:::17308:3:::17308:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::5019432:3:::16949:3:::16949:3:::</endperson>

6477275::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::13.01.2008::::    This phone is incredibly robust - almost indestructable  Mine has, in the three years for which I have owned it, survived being dropped from first floor windows, onto concrete, into rivers, etc. and is still going strong.It is an excellent basic phone with no frills; it is built to send and recieve calls and texts. For those who want a phone, rather than an all-singing, all-dancing, mp3-playing, photographing, colour-screen uber-phone, it is perfect and comes relatively cheap. The one extra you do get is mobile internet access.Recpetion quality is not the best I have seen but also by no means the worst  Obviously this depends to a large extent on the network but I have found that it is perfectly adequate the vast majority of the time.It is well-built, the battery lasts for ages, and it is very user-friendly.All things considered, this is a very good phone, but it is just that - a phone only.     ::::6297090:3:::6297090:3:::6322806:3:::6322806:3:::5828346:3:::5828346:3:::5241315:3:::5241315:3:::5805660:3:::</endperson>

5020146::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::01.04.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is small, stylish and sophisticated.  It  8217;s easy to use with a logical menu system:1. Phone Book   8211; The phone book can store up to 200 entries, it also offers voice activated dialling (which actually works well, I thought I  8217;d always be calling the wrong person ) and speed dialling.  Another useful feature is being able to assign different ring tones to different callers so you can tell who  8217;s calling without having to look at the screen.2. Messages   8211; As well as the basic SMS functions you can store message templates and smiley faces.  The predictive text input function is very useful once you  8217;ve figured out how to use it, it took me a while but the key is in the * key 3. Chat   8211; This allows you to have a chat conversation with others on the same screen.4. Call Register   8211; Tells you your missed calls, recent dialled numbers and call durations   8211; very useful when you are trying to figure out how many free minutes you have left 5. Tones   8211; The Nokia 3310 offers 42 ring tones (7 of which you can choose yourself by downloading from the internet or by using the composer function).  You can also choose to have vibrating alert and can personalise your phone further still by having a screensaver.6. Settings   8211; Okay, this is all the dull stuff like security codes, which are again very useful if you leave your phone lying around or you are forever losing it.7. Call Divert   8211; This gives you the option to divert calls when they are not answered or you have no signal, again useful as people can leave a message if they can  8217;t get through.8. Games   8211; Okay, back to the fun stuff now  There are 4 games on the phone, Snake 2, Pairs 2, Bantumi and Space Impact.  If you are really good at these then you can register with Club Nokia and send your high scores in to see your ranking. 9. Calculator   8211; Well, what can I say  8230;..it does your sums for you   It also has a foreign currency converter  8230;useful for all you travellers out there 10. Reminders   8211; Just like a personal organiser, you can set an alarm to remind you of things.11. Clock   8211; Features an alarm clock (with a snooze function), a stopwatch and a countdown timer.12. Profiles   8211; This is where you can change the phone to silent, discreet, loud or personalise your settings.The phone can be personalised further still by changing the operator logo (orange, vodafone and cellnet are just plain boring ) as well as by using express on covers, if you want to talk into a bottle of bud then that  8217;s your choice So, all in all, the Nokia 3310 is a good buy, it  8217;s definitely more than just a mobile phone   Talk and standby times are good but playing games does tend to drain the battery.  It  8217;s quick to charge (1 hour) so providing you have your charger to hand this isn  8217;t a problem.       ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::3715:4:::15460:4:::15460:4:::5020045:4:::5020045:4:::775:4:::775:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5020753:4:::</endperson>

5191916::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::06.01.2002::::    I have had many phones in my time, an old Motorola, an Ericson, another Motorola, a Nokia 5110 and my latest, the Nokia 3310, and I am only 16.  I started to get interested in mobile phones when I was 15, which is when I got my first Motorola from my mum.  Since then I have had the urge to buy a new and better one every few months.I don   t know if you have noticed, but phones seem to be getting smaller and smaller.  The reason is so that you can lose them and then you will have to buy a new one.  This is true, as I have never lost my old Motorola (which resembled a brick), in fact I still have it, but I lose my Nokia no less than twice a week   In fact I don   t know where it is now.  So, anyway, the point is, I have had many phones and my favourite has got to be the Nokia 3310.  I have tried all different makes and all different networks, and I have found that the Nokia 3310 on Vodafone has been the best for me.  I have always liked Nokias.  They were the first to have games on them and the games are very addictive too.  They are also nice looking and are good if you want to show your phone off to people like I do.The Nokia 3310 has many good features which were different from my old Nokia.  Such as:    Vibrating function (vibrates when you have a call or text message, and even while you play games)    Longer text messages.  They have much more room for writing text messages, so unlike older versions of Nokia, you will hardly ever run out of room.    You can store message templates.    There are many picture messages stored on the phone, which you can send if you are tired of writing messages.    There are covers for the front and back of the phone, so unlike older versions, you can change the whole phone to suit your style.    It can display a screensaver when the phone is idle, not unlike the screensavers on your computer.    There are many new ringtones to choose from, and you can download your favourite song and have it as your ringtone.    There are many new, and very addictive games to play when you are bored and you have nothing better to do.There are also many accessories that you can use with the Nokia 3310.  For more information about them then there is quite useful information on www.nokia.com/phones/3310/accessories.html or you could just go to www.nokia.com to have a look at all the different mobile phones and accessories.  They also have the specifications of the phones, such as weight, dimensions, etc.The Nokia 3310 is quite a heavy phone for its size, but that is not really a bad thing.  At least you will notice if it falls out of your pocket, which they can sometimes do.Another good thing about it is that if you do drop your phone and the case/screen manages to get scratched, then you can always get a new cover.  That is one of the main reasons why I like it so much.  I ended up giving my old phone away because it had scratches on the screen, and you couldn   t change the cover.The battery will last about 4-5 days after being fully charged, and lasts longer if it is just sitting there and not being used.  It takes about an hour to 2 hours to charge.I haven   t found anything wrong with this phone apart from the fact that it is easy to lose.  However, you can easily find out where it is by ringing it and listening for it ringing somewhere.  That is my tip.I got my phone for    100 from my local mobile phone shop, but you could get it on-line at Amazon for    94.99.  Just click on the link below or go to www. Amazon.co.uk Mobile phones do seem to be taking over the world, don   t they?  Everywhere you go there are mobile phones, so if you are going to get one, I would suggest the Nokia 3310.  Although if you want the same phone, but also the ability to surf the web then the Nokia 3330 will be the phone for you.  But it will cost    20 extra.  You can find out about this phone on the Nokia website (www.nokia.com).I hope this opinion has been of help to you      ::::5301118:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5201878:4:::5201878:4:::5286554:4:::5247608:4:::5217683:4:::1692:4:::1692:4:::5211882:4:::5211882:4:::5202843:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5186837:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::5093070:4:::5012563:4:::5020889:4:::5202056:4:::5191901:4:::5026664:4:::5026664:4:::5161824:4:::5016810:4:::5016810:4:::5191859:4:::5191859:4:::5035704:4:::5035704:4:::20081:4:::16641:4:::5040984:4:::5077810:4:::21963:4:::5045906:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5035866:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::5176866:4:::5066688:4:::5066688:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::5191929:4:::12236:4:::12236:4:::5186828:4:::5186828:4:::</endperson>

5000594::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::26.01.2001::::    With x-press on covers the Nokia 3310 lives up to expectations. Its excellent, appealing design is boosted by the ability to choose covers for the phone. Voice dialing is very useful as it allows calls to be made without delving through the mobile phone s directory. Predictive text input is also on this phone although if you do not know how to use it, it can come up with some strange alternatives which only confuse the receiver.The phone boasts a reminder function, holding up to 10 reminders for those times where you may forget something important.Nokia have added icons to text messages so you can now express the style of the message through a picture.With four new games, those who are adicts of the snake game have a new version of the same game but also three new games, designed to waste your batteries life when you are out, and they will as they are addictive.The weight is only 133g with the standard battery and talktime can be up to 4hrs or 10 day standby.The large display enables clear viewing of text messages and menus, a great buy      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::23074:3:::3680:3:::3680:3:::5013173:3:::18021:3:::18021:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::5076519:4:::5076519:4:::15460:4:::15460:4:::5017294:4:::5014991:4:::</endperson>

5352627::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::18.08.2003::::    The Nokia 3310 isn   t the newest of phones, 3 years on the market is condisered old now, and doesn   t offer a fancy colour screen or polyphonic ringtones as the newer models of phones do, but then again the 3310 doesn   t cost upwards of    150  Nowadays you can expect to pay around    70 for one, this would usually include    10 free air time and a sim card on whichever network you fancy. The 3310 has a phone book that can hold up to 100 names and numbers that, unless you are Miss or Mr popularity, will be enough space to keep plenty of your friends and family listed. The text message facility on the phone is simple and very easy to get to grips with. You can type messages the long way by pressing each button a few times, or you can turn    predictive type    on, so you have to do less work. This function is difficult to explain without a phone to show you what to do, but it is easy to work out. You can store 10 text messages on your phone either in your inbox or outbox and also you can send and receive picture messages that range from the cute to the down right disgusting.Ringtones are an important part of the phone and allow you to show off with a funky new tune. You can use the generic Nokia tones (there is 30 tones for you to choose from), you can also download tones from the internet or pay a few pounds to order one from a company. You also have a    composer    that allows you to make and use your very own ringtones. The Nokia 3310 has its fair share of games to keep its user entertained. These games are a Godsend when you are on a long train journey or in a boring car ride, the games include Snake, the ever popular and highly addictive game in which you have to collect little blocks and make your snake longer whilst trying not to crash into yourself. It sounds quite stupid but it is immensely fun.The phone has a calculator built in that is very useful when on the move. You can work out how much your shopping spree is going to come to or whether the person in the Fish and Chip shop did in fact charge you 10p extra. The calculator also has a currency converter on it, which I must admit is very useful. In Majorca last year to work out how much things were in Pounds Sterling as opposed to Euros. There are a number of profiles you can edit and change as you wish. The Nokia 3310 comes with generic profiles such as    general   ,    Silent    and    Loud   . These can be edited and different ringtones and characteristics assigned to each one. You can rename the profiles to suit your personal needs. There are a multitude of different facias (Covers) you can get to jazz up your phone and personalise it. You can also get operator logos for your screen to funk it up. Logos can be bought online or from those adverts that you will always see in magazines. They cost around    1 but some companies will try and con you so beware The phone is stylish, functional and without a doubt the easiest to use phone on the market. The buttons are spaced out nicely and the phone is small enough to fit in your pocket but big enough so that you don t loose it  The phone can be re-charged with any Nokia charger and seeing as Nokias are the best selling phones around you should never have a dead battery again. You can also join Club Nokia and get funky freebies and discounts on official acsessories which is a nice touch.Overall the phone is great, easy to use, stylish and cheap.     ::::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5345005:3:::5345005:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5381851:4:::5368620:4:::5085331:4:::5368993:4:::5374803:4:::5295877:4:::5208225:4:::5208225:4:::5281759:4:::5281759:4:::5279552:4:::5126928:4:::5126903:4:::5247778:4:::5247778:4:::5186846:4:::5240548:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::</endperson>

5018148::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::06.06.2001::::    I recently bought myself a nokia 3310 and it is definatly the best thing i  8217;ve bought for a few years, mine cost me    99.99 which is quite expensive but can be bought on the internet for around    79.99, but I dont have a credit card :( The features: It has 4 games, -snake II (my favourite) -Bantumi -pairs II -space impact These games are all excellent apart from pairs II which is quite a poor attempt at fun. It can have Xpress on covers - I have a black Bacardi one - this gives the phone a personal touch. The phones memory can hold room for up to seven ringtones - either composed or downloaded. It has vibration call alert which is very good when the phone is in silent mode and also very effective whilst playing the games. It has options to use speed dials and voice dials which are pretty cool and save time. Other features include: -90 spaces for names and numbers. -Picture messages. -Screen savers. -Downloadable logo  8217;s. -Chat. -Multiple message sends(send a message to more than one person at a time). -A reminder menu (you set the reminder message and time and at that time the phones alarm will beep and the reminder will be visible on the screen to help you remember important things.) I would recommend buying one if you have the spare pocket change because not only as a play thing but it is also good for sending text messages and for phoning people, the phone normally comes with a free hands-free kit for using your phone on the road (if thats allowed) it also has a very long battery life. I would advise you to purchase one of these phones because of the excellent reception and sound quality, the phone is a vast improvement on previous models, you can clearly make out the person at the other end, even in busy places.And if all that fails you can just download ringtones and logo  8217;s and have it as a mere fashion accessory     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5469307:3:::5091379:4:::5091379:4:::5002380:4:::5013856:4:::5020054:4:::5020054:4:::5040677:4:::5040677:4:::5027357:4:::3447:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5001880:4:::</endperson>

5261509::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::12.11.2002::::    The Nokia 3310 is a stylish and easy to use mobile, it has the versatility that allows you to put your own mark on it easily and simlpy through express on covers, ring tones and logo s. The phone has a number of games which can become addictive so be warned. The phone is fairly light weight and although it is not the smallest nokia on the market it is of a good size that fits into pockets and handbags easily,and is quite difficult to loose. The wide range of user settings with the option of personal preferances allows is great for accommadating all situations that one may face throughout the day. Overall this phone is well worth a try and after having one for over a year now it is highly recommended to all.         ::::6588863:1:::5331903:2:::5240969:2:::1692:2:::1692:2:::5217069:2:::5217069:2:::5261510:2:::5261510:2:::5202449:2:::5202449:2:::5014851:2:::5014851:2:::5261058:2:::5246264:2:::5246264:2:::5116955:2:::5116955:2:::5251198:2:::5260048:2:::5260048:2:::5001205:2:::5001205:2:::5078423:2:::5078423:2:::5255161:2:::7598:2:::7598:2:::5245206:2:::5245206:2:::5217258:2:::5217258:2:::5246250:2:::5246250:2:::5202512:2:::5126903:3:::5268735:3:::5240710:3:::</endperson>

12765::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::09.01.2002::::    I have owned my 3310 for about 6 months now and I must say I am really REALLY impressed with it.Before this I had an Ericcson that suffered terribly with signal strength and sound quality, not to mention being ugly, lacking in features and oddly shaped.With the Nokia 3310, I have a phone that can do so much.Firstly it looks nice.Its small but not too small like some of the flip top Motorolas that you can easily loose.You can get many many different snap on covers to personalise it. My Ericcson did have changeable button plates but that was the limit.The market is full of groovy and whacky phone covers for a 3310 so you can be as individual as you want.The quality of the signal is a big plus point. It does not have an ugly external aerial like the Ericcson had but that does not reduce its strength. I normally have a full signal when in most areas.The sound quality is excellent. Very load if you need it to be, right in your ear. Its crisp and very defined.As for the ringtones, well they are numerous. You can download them directly to your phone if you get bored of the 40 or so that come with it. If you are creative, you can program your own using the ringtone maker on the handset. This also helps personalise it.You can text from this phone too. Handy if you dont want a big bill and just need to let someone know where or when you will meet them or to tell my husband to bring something home with him. It has a smart text function so it  predicts  your words for you. Speeds up the typing no end.There is a handy vibrate function too for when you need to know your phone is ringing in very noisy places. Nightclubs are not a problem for a gal and her phone now The only downside is the price. If you want one off contract, you will pay between    120-150 for one. On contracts you can get them free but are normally tied in for at least a year.You also dont have WAP functions. For this you need to pay for the next phone up, the 3330 or 8210.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5301118:3:::5202189:3:::5202189:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5092284:3:::5022103:3:::5022103:3:::5066721:3:::6297090:4:::6297090:4:::5202843:4:::5203171:4:::5203171:4:::5202813:4:::5023064:4:::5035733:4:::5003492:4:::5003492:4:::5091531:4:::5016207:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5101981:4:::5091379:4:::5091379:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::12236:4:::12236:4:::1704:4:::5186828:4:::5186828:4:::5019928:4:::5191916:4:::5191916:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::21963:4:::20081:4:::5077810:4:::6389:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::</endperson>

5506592::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::31.05.2004::::    LOL.. My dad used this phone, I used this phone before my 8210 and before my 7250i. I still have it today, but it s as a spare. Yes, I m a nokia fan. BIG NOKIA FAN.WHY NOKIA-----------------1. DURABILITY. It s the only phone as far as I know which can stand a thousand falls. I ve dropped my phone so many times I ve lost count. I ve smashed it on the fall because of anger so many time and it still doesn t die. Hands up if you have had the same experience. 3 cheers for nokia 2. Nokia was the first to come up with the xpress cover change. With nokia you feel like you have more than one phone thanks to all these colourful and varied covers. I can even change my 8210 to look like an 8250. Shows how flexible it is as well  Lovely things.3. Easy to change LEDs. You can install so many extra features onto Nokia phones, extra LED bulbs, change the screen picture, background picture, basically there s so many things which you can modify about this phone it s just great.4. Their charges are standard, which means you can use it for almost any nokia phones. Unlike some other brands which the chargers only fit one specific model. The nokia chargers are also small, and direct plug-ins. Very convenient. Some other brands have chargers which are station adapters, bulky and ugly.WHY 3310---------------1. Keypad size. If you have an 8210, or 8310 or something of that size. Admit it, it s really quite hard to type fast messages. With 3310 I broke records on sms speeed times. The size of the keypad i just ideal for those who love smsing.2. The features and functions on the phone are kept simple and boils down to necessity. It includes:- Text features, inbox, outbox- General settings (straight forward instructions)- Song composer - Call register- Address book- Calculator, to do listThese are all the basic functions you need to have a comfortable to use phone. The new gadgets are simply not necessary to be honest. WAP phones just make you spend more money. Why go on the internet using a small handphone while you can surf and do everything much faster on the internet. There s internet cafes everywhere nowadays. 3. SNAKE II. Funny isn t it how I review this as one of the best feature. But so far on mobile phones I think SNAKE is the genius of all games. I ve been addicted to SNAKEII that I play almost everyday, not only at the bus stop or while waiting for friends. I can t believe my new advance 7250i doesn t have snake included, such a dissapointment.4. It suits almost everyone. Not too expensive, not too ugly either. You can t go wrong with this phone. It s not too small for the older generation, so you won t have to worry about putting on glasses to read th pads. SLIGHT disadvantages-------------------------------1. It s a bit bulky for the pockets. I put my phone in my pocket most of the time and this model seems to be a wee bit too big. I would recommend therefore to use 8210 or 7250i if you want something slimmer.2. Battery time. Unlike the latest models, somehow the battery life of this model ends quite early. It lasts for about 2 days on standby before I have to charge it again. This applies to both my dad s phone and mine. 3. No colour screen, small screen. The screen is quite small, so it doesnt look as sophisticated as a 7250i. Younger generation may not like this phone anymore because they find it outdated, dull and not impressive. Personally, I think necessity and function is more important than cosmetics. Beauty is from within :)-----------------------------------------------------------------I think that s about it really. It s a simple phone, doesn t require a sophisticated analysis. I m sure many will like it because of it s simplicity. As Mies Van Der Rohe says it  LESS IS MORE  Cherrio      ::::5472775:3:::5246782:3:::5570116:4:::5487912:4:::5365175:4:::5365175:4:::5459830:4:::14134:4:::5273342:4:::5332070:4:::5332070:4:::5508190:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5459996:4:::5459996:4:::3343:4:::3343:4:::5481686:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5482024:4:::5482024:4:::5504331:4:::5413007:4:::5413007:4:::5458382:4:::5458382:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::</endperson>

5202751::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::16.02.2002::::    Well I   m back (again) and writing about another of my favourite things     THEME PARKS     I love them (except I don   t get much chance to go because my mums to boring and a chicken to take me).So that   s another thing I like my school for, taking us places where our mums won   t.On Tuesday, a few of my friends and I all went to Oakwood Park for the day with the school and had a brilliant time. Fast rides, Lovely food, hardly a queue in sight what more could we ask for, although being in Wales it did rain a bit.  For those of you who don   t know, Oakwood is the only proper Welsh Theme Park, and like Alton Towers has a new ride every year.*****OUR DAY*****There is one bad thing about the day I had to get up at 6.40 to be in school at 7.45 and then the bus didn   t even arrive until 30minutes after it was suppose to. Besides that we got to Oakwood at 9.15 and it doesn   t open until 10.00 so we had to wait outside for 45minutes, luckily we were first in the park then though and ran straight to the new ride     Hydro and then went on to all the other rides.After the little problems in the mornings the rest of the day was fine.*****THE RIDES********WHITE KNUCLE RIDES***o HYDRO     This ride is cool. It is much higher, faster and steeper than Megafobia. Really it is the same as oblivion in Alton Towers except its six centimetres of vertical and you get absolutely drenched and I mean it.You can fit 4 in a row and about 32 people in one carriage; you are strapped in with a belt and a bar, which comes over your head.I wouldn   t recommend this ride to young children, elderly or pregnant people and people with a bad back.Rating *****(5)o MEGAFOBIA     I   ve been on this ride 24 times exactly and it   s still brilliant. It is also called the biggest and best wooden roller coaster ever   I am told it is the biggest wooden roller coaster in Europe.The first drop is 25m plus it has 11 crossovers and a brake over 45kph to stop.  My mum went on it once because she was forced by a friend, she thought she was going to die.2 people in a row and I think about 20 people in a carriage, you are strapped in with a belt and a bar, which comes over your head.I would not recommend this to the same type of people as mentioned for hydro.Rating *****(5)     If you like a faster and wilder ride sit in the back its wicked.o SNAKE RIVER FALLS     There are 3 different slides to choose from in this ride, 2 inside ones called     The Cobra and The Python these just take you round in different directions though dark and light areas etc and 1 outside one this just goes in a straight order but has loads of bumps.You are sat in a small rubber boat, which can fit up to 3 people. The ride is suitable for all ages, although young children have to ride with an adult, I don   t think it would be harmful to people with bad backs.You aren   t strapped in but you hold onto the handles at the sides. You get a bit wet but not absolute soaked     also start eating because the heavier you are the faster you go.Rating ****(4)o BOUNCE     This is quite good     you are blasted 47 metres into the air in seconds then while you are still in shock you are plummeted back down to earth.This ride is square shaped with the people sitting around the outside     6 people in a row, which means a total of 24 people on the ride.You are strapped in with a bar that comes over your head.Rating ***(3)     it use to be really good this ride did but they seem to have made the ride shorter and not as fast.o VOODOO MANSION     I haven   t been on this, the first time I had the chance I was 10 and really scared and the last two times my friends chickened out so I didn   t get to go on it.It   s probably the same as any other haunted house I would think.Not sure how many people you can fit in it.Rating     cant say o VERTIGO     This is NOT included in the entrance fee into the park.  The ride looks as if you flying and has a free fall from a 50metre tower going 110kph in 1.5 seconds it looks really cool and when it is launched the riders screams can sometimes be heard a long way away.  Vertigo can take up to three riders, but if you insist on flying solo it will set you back    30, that   s two people   s entrance fee, for all the other wicked rides.  2 people pay    15 each and 3 people    10 each, despite the price be prepared to queue at busy times.Rating     can   t say but looking at it I would probably give it ****(4) as it looks quite scary and I don   t think it would be worth the money.Most of the white-knuckle rides take pictures towards the end and these can be bought for    3.75, plus some of the rides have shops on the way out where you can buy tee shirts and mugs with the rides name on and stuff like that.DON T FORGET: Most of these rides do have a minimum height restriction and the staff do check.*****FOR THE KIDS*****I haven   t been on any of the kids ride for years so I can   t really comment any.I can remember a few   . there is ao MINI PIRATE SHIP     on this you are on a pirate ship (duh) and you swing back and forth. It is smaller than the normal one so it can   t be as fast or go as high.o MERRY-GO-ROUND     I   m sure you   ve all heard or been on one of these before, you sit on a horse (not a real one of course) and u go up and down and back and forth while an annoying tune is being played over and over again.o MINI GO-CARTS     You sit in a small racing car and have to race people in the other cars round the track.o TECHNIQUEST     This is a science-based centre for young kids.o PLAYGROUND     There are lots of swings and other kiddies    rides here, with a rubber floor that makes falling off a little less painful.*****FAMILY FUN*****o TREE TOPS ROLLERCOASTER     This is a small roller coaster that takes you through the trees (sometimes you think you could bump your head on them), it is quite fast (although not compared to megafobia) but not very long and the seats are a bit low and I hurt my back on it.

5085560::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::30.08.2001::::    Hey why don  8217;t u buy the same phone as everyone else.  HANG ON WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ??? Well it seems everyone is flocking to buy the 3310 and soon it will be as common as the 3210 (read my positive article on this).As I am phone mad I borrowed a mates 3310 while he was out the country and was not too impressed.  Its specifications are:Nokia 3310Phone Features: Weight: 133 g (standard battery) Dimensions: 113x48x22mm, 97cc High contrast full graphics display. Dynamic display layout which adjusts automatically for the best viewing Up to 250 locations in SIM card (the actual number of memory locations in the SIM is SIM specific) Automatic Language selection based on SIM card language (Phase 2 SIM) Menu text   predictive text input 35 fixed and 7 own tones (for composed tone or downloaded tone) Customizable and downloadable profiles Screen saver is based on Picture Message format. Any received Picture Message can be displayed as screen saver. Timer for the screen saver can be set to 5sec.-10min. 4 Games: Snake II, Pairs II, Space Impact, Bantumi Multiple SMS sending: a quick and easy way to send the same message to several persons. Templates: quick and easy sending of pre-defined messages. Picture messages: allows a picture to be sent with text. 7 predefined and replaceable pictures in the phone plus 1 empty slot. Screen savers (5 predefined ones) are viewed in same list as picture messages and can be sent as picture messages Concatenated messages: allows writing messages almost 3 times as long as usual. Smilies for SMS - quick and easy insertion of editable smilies in SMS from smile templates. Mobile Chat: The Nokia 3310 supports Chat based on standard SMS. All previous written messages from both persons are visible on screen. Chat messages are not saved on SIM card. Clock Currency converter Stopwatch Countdown timer Alarm clock Calculator Its best features are:  61623; longer text messages  61623; vibrates when being calls   8211; excellent if you just cannot hear the beep on discreet.  61623; screensaver and many ringtones allowed to be very personasizeable  61623; the reminders and profile are also very usefulIt looks cool, slick and funky (some would even say sexy).  However, In terms of ergonomics the soapbar shape of the 3310 sometimes causes slips and dropsand thus a few breakages. The phone covers are really hard to change and a friend of mine broke the phone the day he bought it as the cover would not even come off so they could put the battery in.  It is known to have some bugs  and It is recommended you get the Asian version.  The Finland model had hundreds (talaga   ) of complaints concerning it just hanging and supposedly needs a new charger.  The china version is lower quality than others and should be avoided.To check you are getting the best quality, type  * 0000  and if the  software version is below 4.02 then STAY AWAY.  The battery is also not very good. I conducted a test-run of its battery life and only took two days (stand-by time and a bit playing of its games) and the battery bar went down fast.  This is useless for me as being on everyday 50 I need call time.There s no easy way to turn off the backlight which is one of the major powerhogs for the battery. If they come up with a fix for the  battery bug  this may help as reconnecting the charger every day is a real pain in the neck. Chat is useless and seems pretty expensive when I got my phone bill.  Snake 2 is nowhere near as good as snake 1 and the Infra Red is sadly lacking.However, most seem to believe the good outweighs the bad and I myself would recommend this over the other common   8216;new  8217; phone the 8210.I will probably update this article when I end up getting this phone myself.

5260805::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::07.01.2003::::    I was in desperate need of a new phone and for christmas santa  was kind enough to buy me one. A Nokia 3310.  This was a phone only so that I could transfer my own sim card across to it, this made it easier as I didn  8217;t have to change my phone number and all the numbers I had in my old phone were not lost. As I am not too clever with new technology this was a good thing.The phone is quite a small one, it measures  11 cms.The phone comes with a charger to charge the battery up when it is running low. When you first get this phone it recommends that you charge it up for 16 hours to fully charge the battery, but after this first time it only takes about 2 hours to fully charge it.There are a number of features for this phone. As well as making a call and writing text messages you can also send picture messages.  The phone contains a phone book which will store up to 99 phone numbers. In this section you can also assign voice tags to certain numbers. The profile area lets you personalise your phone. You can choose what ringing tone you wish to use and there are alot stored in your phone and also blanks so you can store your own. You can also choose whether to have the vibrating alert on, this is quite handy if you cannot hear your phone you will be able to feel it. There is a clock which you can set the time and date onto your phone. There is also an alarm clock which works even if your phone is switched off. Reminders can be put into your phone if you have a bad memory like me. Your phone will ring and remind you of what you are supposed to be doing. There is a calculator which always comes in handy with me. You can also play games on this phone. There are 4 games stored on the phone these are Snake, space invaders, pairs and bantumi.These are always useful to pass a bit of time when you are sat on the train on the way to work.I am still getting the hang of my new phone, but it is alot better than carrying around that old house brick that I used to have. I would recommend this phone to other people. There are alot of accessories  that you can buy to go with this phone like a hands free kit which is alot safer to use whilst driving. Different covers can also be brought for it.I had this phone given to me as a present at christmas so I am not 100  sure of the price, but I am sure that they cost around    79.99 for a sim free phone.     ::::5014851:2:::5014851:2:::5076524:2:::5076524:2:::6389:2:::5261058:3:::5263787:3:::1692:3:::1692:3:::5254759:3:::4665:3:::5080915:3:::5080915:3:::5040909:3:::5260048:3:::5260048:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5285650:3:::5240904:3:::5240661:3:::5240190:3:::5025486:3:::5025486:3:::5269811:3:::5269811:3:::5241570:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::5126903:4:::5253086:4:::</endperson>

5463059::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::04.03.2004::::    Nokia thirty three tens are very good phones. They are small enough to fit in your pocket and there are a massive range of phone covers to fit on them such as covers with singers on them characters on them and you can even put a photograph on a cover, you can also get a lot of  kind of buttons such as multi coloured buttons ones that light up and some have pictures. There are quite a few games available in nokia 3310 such as space impact a game which involes using the number keys to shoot the creatures coming towards you, there are lots of levels and it is guite easy to get the hang of. PairsII a game where you can pick what ever level you would like to start at and if you would rather do a puzzle or a time trial the point of the game is to pick pairs to reveal a picture. Batumi a game which involves tactics and is quite puzzling. It involves moving stones from small cups to your main cup and stealing the computers stones. And last but certainly not least my favourite game Snake II where you have to collect food and not to bang into walls, you have a choice of lots of different mazes and what level to start at. With the phone you get 35 ring tones, but there is a composer which you can use to compose ringtones which you can then put at any volume ot any speed you want i find the composer very useful fun and easy. With you phone you get a wide selection of picture messages which you can send to people and use as logos you can then decide how long the phone has to wait before the logo apears. There is a clock section in these phones where you can decide if you want the time to apear on the manu screen and you can use it as a stop watch or as an alarm clock. If you go some where were you have to be quiet, you can turn your phone to silent which means  that if anybody calls you can feel it vibrate and you are not disturbing anybody, I find this very useful in class at school. To conclude this review I would lo say I would recomend NOKIA 3310 phones to anybody who is needing a mobile.      ::::5411834:2:::5411834:2:::5373984:2:::5437203:2:::5437203:2:::5023548:2:::5023548:2:::5442252:2:::5014851:2:::5014851:2:::5399644:2:::5399644:2:::5000594:2:::5000594:2:::5458728:3:::5458728:3:::5078423:3:::5078423:3:::5116955:3:::5116955:3:::</endperson>

5018131::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::26.02.2001::::    The Nokia is the coolest.  The shape is smart, has cool games and I like how you want to call some one all you have do is say their name and it  8217;s calling them.  But the Nokia 3310 has snake 2.  I  8217;ve not played it yet but it looks cool.  It has address books.  But I like the most is the calling thing.  The Nokia 3310 is small so you could put in your pockets which is really handy.  If you want a Nokia 3310 you can get them at most shops.  But the best shop to get them is at dk communications.  The insurance is cheap which is good and it includes if you have lost it, damaged or stolen.  I recommend this for its shape, games, the calling thing and the address book.  I give this item a wonderful 99 .                 ::::5291026:1:::5001205:1:::5001205:1:::5017914:1:::5277861:2:::5277861:2:::5489995:2:::23574:2:::23574:2:::7733:2:::</endperson>

5360307::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::11.07.2003::::    The Nokia 3310 is a good reliable phone. It has all the normal features you would expect such as a phonebook, ringtones, security features and sms messaging. you also 3 games snake 2, an up to date and faster version of snake found on earlier nokias, pairs, a version of the classic  card game game pairs with some extra twists and 9 different levels, and  space impact which is almost like you would find on a pc or games console in which you go through the levels shooting aliens and collecting point.                The phone ccomes with roughly 30 of it s own in built ringtones but you can order ringtones from magazines and the internet onto the 3310 and also send them to and recieve them from other mobile phones.You can also send and recieve sms picture messages (obviously not ones taken from a camera phone but ones drawn on other phones.          You Can use your phonebook to assign ringtones to different callers and have different ringtones and volume of the phone for different situations using the profiles feature. The profiles feature also lets you have different wallpaper for your main screen and a screensaver. You Can store up to 100 names and numbers in your phone book.           The reminders feature on the 3310 lets you put in reminders for different times and dates and acts as an alrm clock to let you know when you need to do different things. The phone also has an alarm clock feature which goes off even if the phone is switched off            This phone is a nice shape and size, It is quite lightweight. It has changeable back and front covers and does not wear very quickly. On most networks the reception is quite good although there have been times that i have lost all reception completely but i think this maybe due to network rather than the phone.        Overall this phone is easy to use and very reliable the only thing which lets it down is the introduction of colour phones, phones with cameras and the new video messaging phones. My only other downfakll to this phone is the battery can need replacing quite quickly if it is used alot and not let to rundown completely before it is charged.                Where this phone is so easy to use i would reccomend it for most people. It is aalso a good phone for a first phone for adults and younger teenagers alike.     ::::5368993:3:::5284267:3:::5284267:3:::5254771:3:::5254771:3:::3338:3:::3338:3:::5349704:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5288301:3:::5320274:3:::5246435:3:::5314908:3:::5297072:3:::</endperson>

5244950::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::06.10.2002::::    I will be the first to admit, that to be perfectly honest I cannot stand people with mobile phones, or as I call them, the mobile phone crew.  I think it is downright antisocial to sit in a room full of people, and play with some poxy phone on a game that to be perfectly honest is little more than pants.  I will also admit to owning a phone though, and as you will obviously has guessed, it is the nokia 3310.  What first drew me to the phone was originally the fact I wanted bt cellnet (now O2) as the network, because orange, my last network, was just too dam pricey.The real drawback with this phone is definitely the price, some would say that paying the extra for the 3330, just because you get WAP is worth it, but bearing in mind I have the internet at home, it wasn t for me.  Retailing a measly phone at 80 quid is downright disgusting, it isn t even like they are the pinnacle of modern technology, and bearing this in mind, it was extremely hard for me to actually part with the cash to pay for it.  The last phone I had was the Ericsson A2816 (I think that s the name of it anyway), and it was absolutely bombproof, it even went through the washing machine after a mix up once but that is a different story altogether, so I was not sure at all if the nokia would stand up to the hard life that I would be facing it with.  I needed a phone with a few things, first and foremost was the cellnet network, second, it had to be fairly light and durable, and thirdly it had to be able to take a beating and take the knocks, and so far, the 3310 hasn t disappointed.  It is fairly lightweight, which is one of the criteria I wanted, the cases are interchangeable, so even if it does take a knock a bit too big for the case to cope with, they can be changed, it also has a range of networks, and as you guessed again, mine is cellnet.  Now to get down to some of the technical stuff (and no snake doesn t technically class as technical I know).Righty first things first (again).  The menu screen is easy to get to, merely press ok, and you are there, you will find all of the phones options: phonebook, messages, chat, call register, ringers, settings, call divert, games, calculator, reminders, clock, profiles and finally my services.  They are all easy to use, and easy to work your way around.  You can send and receive picture messages, logos, which as they say, makes the phone all the more personal.  There is the option for it to vibrate upon message or call alert (personal fave I must admit).  There is also a ring tone composer in there so you don t just have to download tones.  There is space for 7 ring tones of your own choice, aswell as the tones that are pre-programmed into the phone     ::::5207600:3:::5207600:3:::5240190:3:::5095870:3:::5208443:3:::5208443:3:::5000858:3:::5000858:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5186837:3:::5003280:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5241467:4:::5244881:4:::5244149:4:::</endperson>

5102034::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::22.11.2001::::    I have only had this phone since May when my contract was renewed. Before this handset i had the Ericcsson T18, which now seems like a distant memory. This handset is lightweight, but a decent size, it is not too small or like a  brick . One function of this phone that i have found an added bonus is that the handset allows you to send a text with 459 characters, which is far greater than standard handsets, which means u can write a really long message but you only get charged for one text message. There is also a function that you can select on the handset that sends you message reports that lets you know when the message has been delivered to the mobile that you have sent it to. (So nobody can deny not receiving it when you have seen a report saying that the message has been delivered ) The keys are very user friendly, you do not have to press hard, but they are not over sensative. This phone also has the express on function facility and is marginally easier, in my opinion, to change than previous nokia express on phones. This handset also has a variety of games, which i find useful to keep myself occupied when i am on the train or waiting at a bus stop etc. Previous Nokia enthusiasts who enjoyed the games facility will be pleased to know that this phone has snake version 2, which is more advanced than the origonal, as well as another 3 games, one of which is space invaders that is also fun. This phone has so many added features that it is very impressive.

5066496::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::06.07.2001::::    I have only had this phone since May when my contract was renewed. Before this handset i had the Ericcsson T18, which now seems like a distant memory. This handset is lightweight, but a decent size, it is not too small or like a  brick . One function of this phone that i have found an added bonus is that the handset allows you to send a text with 459 characters, which is far greater than standard handsets, which means u can write a really long message but you only get charged for one text message.There is also a function that you can select on the handset that sends you message reports that lets you know when the message has been delivered to the mobile that you have sent it to. (So nobody can deny not receiving it when you have seen a report saying that the message has been delivered )The keys are very user friendly, you do not have to press hard, but they are not over sensative. This phone also has the express on function facility and is marginally easier, in my opinion, to change than previous nokia express on phones.This handset also has a variety of games, which i find useful to keep myself occupied when i am on the train or waiting at a bus stop etc. Previous Nokia enthusiasts who enjoyed the games facility will be pleased to know that this phone has snake version 2, which is more advanced than the origonal, as well as another 3 games, one of which is space invaders that is also fun.This phone has so many added features that it is very impressive. One that is particularly useful is the reminder function, where you enter what you want to be reminded of, for example  exam , then it asks for the date, and the time that you want to be reminded. I find this very useful as i am quite frequently forgetting things I could go on forever, but in general the Nokia 3310 is attractive to look at, a decent size, lightweight with several impressive functions that have certainly impressed me      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5309724:3:::5035704:3:::5035704:3:::5017028:3:::5017028:3:::17410:3:::17410:3:::5046089:3:::5156818:4:::5066721:4:::5022551:4:::5022551:4:::5077555:4:::5085480:4:::5085480:4:::5091097:4:::5091097:4:::5021202:4:::5021202:4:::5085968:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::16615:4:::5079792:4:::5079792:4:::5035960:4:::5035960:4:::5013095:4:::5013095:4:::9532:4:::5035798:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5066395:4:::5066395:4:::5020237:4:::5045874:4:::5027077:4:::5065948:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5026657:4:::5026657:4:::19266:4:::5003492:4:::5003492:4:::5016911:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5035866:4:::23074:4:::6636:4:::5000594:4:::5000594:4:::</endperson>

5013071::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::29.01.2001::::    I wasn t going to buy a mobile phone until my friend showed me their Nokia 3310. I was amazed at how small the phone is and at how light it is. The games are excellent. You have Snake 2, Bantumi, Pairs 2 and the new Space Impact. You can have 7 of your own ringtones and compose your own. I also find the reminders option and the built-in alarm clock very useful. For sending text messages it has a word predictor. I would recommend this phone to any first time mobile users, like me as it is simple to use and fairly cheap to buy. I am currently on Orange which I am delighted with as the off peak calls are very cheap. It is a fantastic upgrade from the Nokia 3210.     ::::23574:2:::23574:2:::5001532:2:::17253:2:::17253:2:::5045921:3:::5045921:3:::5045874:3:::</endperson>

5013::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::15.02.2001::::    This is the babe of all phones, whilst it does feel a ittle plasticy, it is just so easy to use, and has so many features it more than makes up for this lacking. I use my phone mainly for text messaging people, and the chat feature, and of course the ability to join upto three text messages, and so write text messages upto 459 characters long makes this the phone for me. I am looking for decent covers for ti at the moment, and have found that they are distinctly lacking, but if things go as they did for the 3210 I shouldnt be waiting long. The phone also has good reception and the calls are very clear, but i m waiting for it to come out with a metal case before i can give it 5 stars     ::::5015764:2:::17308:2:::17308:2:::5012148:2:::5012148:2:::5001622:2:::4228:2:::5015372:4:::</endperson>

5017453::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::05.02.2002::::    Mobile phones, the bain of some peoples lifes and the coolest most important fashion accessory for others. The Nokia 3310 certainly will not win an award for being the coolest cat on the block but it want win minger ringer of the year either.So what are the pros and cons of this piece of Kit?The phone itself is weighted nicely, not too light but not heavy to put in your pocket. The size is also not bad, buttons big enough for a bloke, unlike some phones where the big fingered among us press three buttons at once. The display screen is also a nice size, unlike the small Sony phones etc which are just a slot. This phone has all the features, it is good for hands free use and the standby time is more than adequateBut, he come the downers from my point of view. I have no idea of cost as I didn t pay for it, but I believe the costs are closely linked to the tariff you subscribe to not the handset (unless bought separately). My main problem with this phone is that it is too common and it s a litle bit embarasing being in a bar when everyone else has a trendy phone and yours rings and youm pull out a 3310. Although i keep telling my self when you get it paid for, beggars can t be chosers.      ::::5001205:2:::5001205:2:::5021406:3:::5021406:3:::5041033:3:::5041033:3:::5066322:3:::5102019:3:::5066721:3:::5126918:3:::6389:3:::5085331:3:::20229:3:::20229:3:::</endperson>

5023993::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::23.04.2001::::    I just read another op on this but it was too short for my liking so I thought I would whinge a bit more My brother bought this phone when it first came out to replace his 3210 and except for a couple more features, it isn t that much more different. In fact, it s pretty much an  advanced clone .  But then again, all new models of a ceratin series are  The Nokia 3310 is shaped differently to the Nokia 3210 (its slightly more smoother looking) and the extra features it contains are a Chat facility, and several games such as a Space Invaders type game, Bantumi (A skill/logic game which is totally addictive ), and the usual snake, Rotation and Memory.  If you love playing games on phone then this is the one for you.It also has a MASSIVE button top of the phone that serves no purpose but to switch it and off.  It makes you wonder, why is a button this big needed  Hmmm...to make it different from the 3210 perhaps?The Chat facility seems a total waste.  You can achieve the same sort of instant messaging through text messaging    The one thing it has got going for it is the composer which lets you compose those annoying tunes that constantly seem to suffocate the atmosphere these days (Nothing Personal - These tunes just really annoy me )  The rest of the menu consists of a Phone Book, Messaging, Calender, Calculator, Games, Services. Oh yes - one more grumble: It doesn t have infra-red The phone isn t that heavy or big and has changeable covers.  I wouldn t recommend this phone if you want to look like a sleek business woman/man.  Instead a Sony, Motorolla Wings or Nokia 800+ looks sleeker, more serious and stylish.  Try and avoid this phone if you can.     ::::5022103:2:::5022103:2:::5001498:2:::5001519:2:::5001519:2:::17690:3:::17690:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::5018900:3:::18192:3:::18192:3:::5001532:3:::5020891:3:::5020891:3:::5020426:3:::5020426:3:::6045:4:::5080927:4:::5026124:4:::5035582:4:::1704:4:::5022480:4:::5022480:4:::5020893:4:::</endperson>

5022505::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::07.04.2001::::    Well, its a nokia. That almost guarantees quality. It has the usual visual layout of the nokia phones, and the menu is the same as on past nokias. It has the usual nokia games, that do look better than on past models. It has a ring tone composer, and you can send and receive ring tones as well as operator logos that appear on the top of the screen. The 3310 is extremely good looking, I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. I know lots of people that feel the same way. The buttons have been precisely designed to be exactly the right size, and right distance apart, allowing extreme ease of use. The screen is perfect, not too small as on some alternative. The  Hidden  aerial is also great, as it reduces the size dramatically, and  doesnt dig into your leg when its in your pocket. Also the great feature of x-press on covers means that you can change the look of your 3310 for little more than    10.The menu has all the usual Nokia Features, the 99 name phone book and the ability to send ant receive text and picture messages with the added predictive text input (which dramatically reduces the tedious length of time to write a text message). the is also the option for a text chat which means the message are delivered immediately. The call register option allows you to see the last ten calls made and received, to see any missed calls and to find your available credit. You can change or make up your own ring tones, as well as set different ring tones for different people. You can set up a PIN code to only allow you to use the phone and setup other security settings. There are four games on the phone, snake 2, space impact, bantumi and pairs 2, all extremely addictive    There are also calculator, clock and stopwatch features aswell as reminders, that pop up and tell you to do whatever you may forget.Its extremely strong and robust, standing up to the rough and tumble of everyday phone usage. there is also the benefit of the changeable covers which means that if you do have an accident and scrath or break the cover, you can alwats buy a new one.The vibrating alert is extremely useful if you find yourself in a situation where noise from the phone will disrupt whatever you are doing (such as a meeting). It notifies you whenever someone is calling you, or when you have received a text message, and does it very descretely.The supplied battery gives between 2hours and  4 hours talk time, between 60 and 250 hours standby and takes about 4 hours to recharge fully. Other accessories can be brought for the 3310, including longer lasting batteries, the x-press on covers, headsets, seperate battery chargers, and car hands-free kits.It can be bought on any pay as you go network for    100 and also can be got for free on contract. If you do get it on pay as you go, you need to buy top up vouchers, and it also has    5 credit already on it.I have had no problems with my 3310, neither has anyone i know. It does its job superbly, and i havent regretted spalshing out the princely sum of    100. The overall combination of its stylish design, its amazing ease of use and its incredible list of features make this phone far superior to any other. Anyone who is considering buying a new phone and can afford    100 should get this. i may sound like a nokia salesman, but i honestly beleive is is the best phone on the market.I strongly recommend that you consider buying this marvellous phone, as it is by far the best on the market. words cant describe how good it actually is. both me and my friends agree that this is definately worth buying, and is sheer brilliance. alternatives such as the motorola V2288 and the nokia 3210 dont even come close to this.I hope this review has helped you make up your mind, and that you will consider buying this phone.     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::10438:4:::5022205:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5020168:4:::22828:4:::22828:4:::5022768:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::18848:4:::18848:4:::</endperson>

1177::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::09.03.2001::::    Huuuummmmmm, I probably need to explain that a bit further don t I before I get censored     So let me explain what I mean before I go any further. Despite working for Orange I didnt know too much about the features on this handset before we launched it and unfortunately my job role has changed so I don t get to test out the new handsets before anyone else anymore. It was because of this that I was shocked to see a full screen picture of a couple indulging in some, shall we say, interesting activities on a handset I didn t recognise. When I looked a bit closer I saw it was a Nokia 3310 and the picture was a picture message downloaded from the internet converted into a screensaver, one of the new features on this particular phone. So OK, this functionality doesn t serve any real purpose but what a conversation piece    Anyway, I decided to borrow one for a couple of days to check it out, although I only had it for 2 days I saw enough in that time to convince me that this is another excellent addition to the Nokia range. I ve since read one or two other reviews where this handset has been compared to the 3210 and all I can say to that if anybody actually believes this I suggest they compare the spec sheets a bit closer, this is a lot more advanced and easily eclipses the 3210 in both features and functionality (I ll mention them as I go along) It s actualy got everything that I myself personally need in a handset (apart from size) and as such I would not have hesitated in getting one if I didn t already own an 8210 which only beats this because of its size Its inherited most of the excellent Nokia features of more high level handsets such as the calendar/reminder functions (which the 3210 hasnt got) and profiles, again missing from the 3210. It s got voice tags as well although I didnt get to try these out I would imagine you will experience the same problems with these where they are next to useless unless your in a quiet environment. Oh yeah, the 3210 doesnt have these either. In addition to this it also has a couple of new features (in addition to the screensaver) the most useful of which (and one which will make it a best seller with the younger generation) is the multiple text message function. With this you can send the same message to loads of different people rather than having to do it individually. In addition to the above you can see a sequence of messages in the  conversation  at the same time so you wont lose track of the conversation. Oh yeah, and if your that way inclined you can even add a real smiley to the message instead of the more conventional :-) abbreviation, eeeerrrmmm, neither of these are available on the 3210. Add the above to the now compulsory interchangeable fascias and you can see why it s going to be a top seller with youngsters. The difference is though it is also a very business like handset so I think it will go down well with older users as well. As for alerts, as are most new handsets its capable of accepting customised ringing tones, BUT, it s also got a vibrating alert which guess which phone hasn t ? Yep, the 3210. The only gripe I would have about this handset is the bulkiness of it, and the one element the 3210 wins on. I found it cumbersome to use and even more inconvenient to slip in my pockets, this though is because I ve got used to the 8210 which is miniscule compared to this    In summary I would say that this is an excellent buy and if you can afford it, it s 99.99 at the moment on Just Talk, I would strongly recommend it. The price will undoubtedly come down though if your willing to wait. So, a brilliant phone and one I would not hesitate in recommending. Oh yeah, it might sound as if I m slagging the 3210 off in the above article, I m not, in fact far from it .... so why compare it so unfavourably? As I said earlier I have read some reviews where people have said it s no better than the 3210. This I believe is because the people making these statements are just after a quick few reads and havent really bothered checking the 3310 out properly ... yeah, it looks similar, the keys are exactly the same layout, it s model number seems to follow on 3210 - 3310, and it s about the same size but as you can see from even the basic review above its clearly a lot more advanced. So please dont be put off the 3210 by my negative comparisons to the 3310, its a brilliant handset in it s own right (see my review on it if you dont believe me) but it s now been overtaken by the 3310. Granted, if your on a tight budget the 3210 is the best option but please dont not buy the 3310 just because some one has misinformed you about its superiority to the older model .... RANT OVER          ::::5019701:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5065881:4:::5021043:4:::5018249:4:::5012269:4:::5012269:4:::5002696:4:::5012426:4:::20081:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::3715:4:::5016911:4:::23544:4:::</endperson>

4903::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::27.02.2001::::    What do you get in the box?.. Well under the Orange pay as you go network you receive:Phone with grey cover (front and back)Hands free kitChargerSIM cardUser guideAfter reading through all the bumph that came with my spanking new Nokia 3310 it was time to have a little play. Bit of a disappointment as it has to be charged for 16 hours but then you can switch on, you are immediately sent a message with a SIM update (under pay as you talk on the Orange network).The menu system is the same as on all the older Nokia phones but with a few added attractions. The main headings are scrolled through using the up and down keys. This is the only problem I have found. The phone is small so the buttons are small which, if you have big fingers you will find hitting the right button a bit of a problem. Each main menu has a section number and the sub menus carry on from this e.g. phonebook search is 1-1. This has been created so you can use short cuts to each of the menus.  So under the menu function you have:~ Phone book: sub menus include   8211; search, add name (you can store up to 90 names), erase, edit, assign tone, send b  8217;card, options, speed dials, voice tags (allows you to dial just by speaking into the phone).~ Messages: sub menus include   8211; write message, inbox, outbox, picture message (can send pictures between particular phones), templates (pre-set messages, useful if you are sending same message to loads of people), smileys (saves having to type :-)), message settings, service command editor.~ Chat: you can have a conversation via text messages with another person. ~ Call register: sub menus include   8211; missed calls, received calls, dialled numbers, erase recent calls lists, show call duration, prepaid credit. ~ Tones: sub menus include   8211; ringing tones, ringing volume, incoming call alert, composer (lets you create your ringtones), message alert tone, keypad tones, warning tones, vibrating alert, screensaver.~ Settings: sub menus include   8211; call settings, phone settings, security settings, restore factory settings.~ Games: sub menus include   8211; Snake2, Space Impact, Bantumi, Pairs2, settings.~ Calculator: all the usual functions for adding, subtracting etc~ Reminders: sub menus include   8211; add new, view all, erase. Forget birthdays or other important dates, then this is what you need.~ Clock: sub menus include   8211; alarm clock, clock settings, date setting, stopwatch, countdown timer, auto update of date and time. ~ Profiles: sub menus include   8211; general, silent, discreet, loud, my style.The feature I love about this phone is the fact you can change front and back covers to suit your personality or mood. Covers can be purchased from all good mobile phone shops and off the internet; they start in price from about    14.If you aren  8217;t content with the 35 ringtones already included then you also have the option to compose your own. This is quite difficult if you don  8217;t know what you are doing but I have found a brilliant website (http://www.andrews180.freeserve.co.uk/index2.html) that tells you which buttons to press for the required tone be it Simpsons to Mission Impossible. You can create up to 7 tunes of your choice and they are easily selected via the ringing tones menu. Ringtones can also be downloaded from websites which are springing up all over the place at the moment. You usually get charged about    2.50 for these.The area in the phone where the network name is displayed can also be changed (try www.bluebolt.com). I currently have the NO FEAR logo but there are hundreds to choose from (cartoon characters, pop star names, your name the list goes on and on, it just depends what sort of thing you like). Best thing about them is that they are free.I bought my phone off the internet because it was    10 cheaper (I paid    89.99) than any of my local stores with an extra accessories pack worth    50 free. I would highly recommend the site www.talkingshop.co.uk. Loads of great offers but I suppose that is another review:-).     ::::5019050:1:::5390559:3:::5309724:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::5035582:4:::5001532:4:::12077:4:::5012948:4:::5012948:4:::14626:4:::5016866:4:::6636:4:::5002171:4:::5013173:4:::5019505:4:::5018900:4:::17253:4:::17253:4:::5012276:4:::20081:4:::5000696:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::10539:4:::1704:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::5012426:4:::5371:4:::5371:4:::18021:4:::18021:4:::9435:4:::23569:4:::8421:4:::8421:4:::22828:4:::22828:4:::19851:4:::19851:4:::5018131:4:::4677:4:::</endperson>

5371::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::04.01.2001::::    I have to start this opinion off by saying that this phone is probably THE best phone on the market right now. You have it s predecessor, the 3210, which I did nt like, because the weight was nt balanced over the phone properly. The 8210, and the 8850, which are both too small, fiddly, light, and expensive for mobile phones to be worth it, and the other brands of phones, which i m sorry to say don t quite reproduce the quality of phones that nokia do. Along comes the 3310. The 3310 manages to combine the stylishness of the 3210, with the functionality of any other phone on there. It has more functions than most nokia phones, including the 8210. Despite its size, the 3310 also has virtually the same talktime and standby times as the 3310 (and obviously more than the 8210). It also weighs a lot less than the 3210 (in phone terms )There are 35 ring tones, plus an additional 7 you can make up yourself, using the intuitive composer. The ringtones can also be sent to other phones via SMS text messages, or sent the same way to your phone (try www.boltblue.com to get started). Operator logos can also be obtained from logo companies, which changes the operator s logo to something you might like a bit more. This allows for the ultimate in customization of your phone, meaning even if you have the same phone as someone else, it will be different. There s vibrating alert, which not only discreetly alerts you to incoming phone calls, but vibrates at certain moments while playing one of the four games. This feature can be turned on or off at the users discretion, which is handy, especially if you are in an area where a noisy ringtone would disturb a quiet atmosphere (like at the cinema).The Games are probably what makes Nokia phones so popular. It s just so convenient to have something to pass the time by with if your on a journey or something. Theres Snake II - an update of the classic snake we all know and love, this time with added mazes, improved graphics, and bonus items for more points. Space Impact, which is an excellent sideways scrolling shoot  em up, guiding you through waves of enemy ships and bosses. Pairs II, another update of a classic, with better pictures, and added game modes. Finally, Bantumi, a strange game involving dropping peas into pots(? ?) These games are utterly addictive (I have very high scores to prove it  2003 on snake II and 10620 on Space Impact) But I suppose we could have seen one or two more original games on there.Both front and back covers can be changed, if the standard blue does nt meet with your approval (i reccomend the arctic silver covers). The phone can be further personalised with picture messaging, which allows pictures to be sent along with normal messages, screensavers, which change the appearence of the display if the phone is not being used, and the logos and ringtones as mentioned above.Along with all these amazing features, there are the now standard features, such as a clock, stopwatch, reminders, calculator, currency convertor, and a new feature called chat. This involves multiple phone users to join chat  rooms . This works in the same way as many internet chat rooms, but if you wanted to make a contribution to the room, you d send messages via SMS. This is in it s early stages, and is quite expensive as well. An example of a chat providers costs are 12p for every message, or contribution made to the discussion, and 6p to recieve a similar message. As one can see, the costs would soon mount up, however,  there is the option to set a limit on how much you can spend in one chat sessionAll in all, though, a marked improvement on the 3210, bettering even the 8210 for style and functions, making the phone easy to use, great value, and a phone that is so stylish and packed full of features and games, it should become very popular.     ::::4677:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5002380:3:::23544:3:::5001532:3:::19851:3:::19851:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5324791:4:::5324791:4:::18192:4:::18192:4:::5019733:4:::5002378:4:::5002378:4:::20081:4:::15460:4:::15460:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::17496:4:::10438:4:::5002171:4:::13861:4:::13861:4:::</endperson>

5270678::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::23.12.2002::::    My mobile phone   8211; annoyingly addictive games, ringtones that drive me up the wall and I spend a small fortune on keeping it   8220;up to date  8221; and yet I can  8217;t live without it  I thought I  8217;d write a review on my own mobile model   8211; The Nokia 3310   8211; so I  8217;m going to stop rambling now and get on with it.I first chose my model basically because all mates had one and it was the   8220;coolest  8221; one to have  But now I think I would of chosen this one anyway.It has an attractive coverage that can be changed at any stage and is a nice comfortable size (not a brick, not a tiny thing) and the screen is large enough. It also lights up during usage so games can be played in the dark     The Features   8211;Phone Book (well obviously)- In this you can do the obviously thing and store names and numbers of your friends and family. However with this model of mobile it has a   8220;voice tag  8221; device and you can record your voice saying the names of a few of your contacts and use the   8220;voice tagging  8221; system to find them easily. Another Feature in the phone book is the business card. You can send them to your friends with other friends phone numbers on them and it costs the price of text message   8211; a handy facility if you are hopeless (like me) at remembering numbers.You can also assign certain tones to people   8211; so you could you could have the Death March for your work place and The Magic Roundabout for everyone else (because who doesn  8217;t love The Magic Roundabout).  Your phone book also gives you the option to speed dial certain numbers, provides you with information help line numbers for your phones particular network (e.g. Orange, O2, T-mobile, Virgin, Vodaphone etc.) and you can look up your memory status (that tells you how many number you have stored and how many available spaces you have on your sim card to store numbers on). Messages   8211;With this feature you obviously have your inbox where you can pick up your text messages. You can also save messages in your outbox. With this particular model of nokia phone you can send and receive picture message and your phone already comes with 14 standard picture messages.   The Nokia 3310 also allows you to save   8220;templates  8221;, the when typing a message you can select a template to use to save yourself time. The phone does come with standard templates but more can be added and standard   8220;templates  8221; can be changed.Smileys e.g. :) :( can be saved in your phones memory too  A separate section is available to save smileys in and can be added to your messages quickly.While typing messages with this model of phone you can use   8220;predictive text  8221;. Because the numbers on the phone keypad correspond to 2 or more letter it can take quite a while to type out a message. If you use predictive text the phone guesses the word you are typing so the process doesn  8217;t take as long. If the word the phone guesses is incorrect, it can simple be change either by pressing the * key and scrolling through then options or typing it out manually.Chat- This is a feature I do not yet properly understand. It gives you the option to choose a chat name and then you type what you want to say in the form of a short text message. Then the message is sent (at normal cost) to who ever you want to send it to. For example, if I chose my chat name as   8220;princess_lucy  8221; and I wanted to say   8211;   8220;hi, what time are we meeting up in town this afternoon  8221;, the message would be laid out like this:Princess_lucy: hi, what time are we meeting up in town this afternoon.I don  8217;t really understand this feature properly because it is almost the same as sending a text message to a friend except that you can  8217;t fit as much into a   8220;chat  8221; message.Call Register   8211;In this section you can find out and look all the recent number you have dialled, and the people who you have had missed calls from, all then people you have received calls. You can also look at your last call duration, all the calls you have made duration (in total) all the calls you have received duration (in total) and all your calls  8217; totals. This is a useful feature as you can look back at call you have missed; then you can deleted all your call lists (if there is somebody you don  8217;t like on there) and claim you never received or missed any call and you nothing about therefore did not return the call, (I  8217;m not that evil really   8230;.).Tones   8211; This is where you can select you message tones and ringtones. There are free spaces in your ringtones section to download tones off the Internet or receive them from you friends.  The phone comes with about 30 standard tones already saved and they are not all that naff   There is a range of tones for receiving messages   8211; well about 3  But at least it  8217;s variety Under the tones section you are given the option to   8220;compose  8221; your own ringtones so if you are an up and coming Mozart this is perfect feature for you. You can also search the internet for   8220;composer tones  8221; and copy them into your phone this is handy if you want a new tone but haven  8217;t enough credit on your mobile to buy one.From this section you can also choose to turn vibrations, warning tones, keypad tones, and incoming alerts on or off.Settings- Funnily enough this is where you control the main setting of the phone and calls.In   8220;call settings  8221; you have the option to choose who your speed dials are and whether to turn your own number sending on or off.  8220;Phone settings  8221; allows you to change the phone language settings (helpful if you don  8217;t understand the current language ). From here also you can change your welcome note.The other sections under   8220;Settings  8221; include   8220;security settings  8221; where you can change your PIN code and security codes and   8220;restore factory settings  8221; which is pretty self-explanatory.Call Divert   8211; This section give you the option to divert your calls either to your voicemail box or another number. It allows you to choose when to divert calls (e.g. when the phone is switched off) and where too.Games-The best feature  Games include Snake 2, Space impact, Bantumi and Pairs 2. I shall give a quick review on each of them :Snake 2: Perhaps the most well know and addictive game. In involves you controlling the direction of the   8220;snake  8221; with the phone keypad to the   8220;food  8221; without crashing into itself. Version   8220;Snake 1  8221; is available on older Nokia phones.Space Impact: Basically you are a space craft that shoots little alien things (a bit like space impact) you can choose the position the   8220;spaceship  8221; shoots from with the phone keypad. This can cause severe finger cramp Bantumi: I hate this game  It  8217;s like tiddly- winks only not  You play against the phone and put little counter things into tubs   8211; stupid and annoying  I hate it  That might be because I am rubbish at it  Pairs 2   8211; Just like the traditional game of pairs you have to match up pictures. You can choose whether to play a time trial game of just normal pairs. Version   8220;Pairs 1  8221; is available on older Nokia phones.The other 4 features are the   8220;Calculator  8221;,   8220;Clock  8221; which has an stop clock and alarm facilities,   8220;Reminders  8221; that can be used with the alarm and   8220;Profiles  8221;, Silent, Loud ect.I think that  8217;s it if not buy on and work out the rest for yourself lol  Hope this helps, I personally wouldn  8217;t choose any other phone type than Nokia because they have so many features and are so easy to use  Lucy 14                                         ::::5280395:3:::5280395:3:::5263670:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5331212:4:::5307399:4:::5307399:4:::5274315:4:::5277178:4:::5271962:4:::5254771:4:::5254771:4:::5271956:4:::5271956:4:::5261270:4:::5261270:4:::5240877:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5247778:4:::5247778:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::5202792:4:::4738:4:::4738:4:::6389:4:::5091531:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5126903:4:::5253846:4:::5253846:4:::5257770:4:::5002913:4:::5002913:4:::5244008:4:::2854:4:::2854:4:::5278808:4:::5246250:4:::5246250:4:::5239955:4:::5239955:4:::5280056:4:::</endperson>

5223603::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::21.06.2002::::    I m the most accident prone person I know and because of this I have been through a large amount of phones, I ve dropped them down the toilet, smashed them up, got them run over.... the list goes on. So when I say this phone is durable take my word for it Although risking contradicting myself I ve had two phone screens break for this phone. One was because I dropped it so you can t really blame the manufacture, but one just broke and the screen I have now occasionally gets a few pixels not working. It ll cost around    30 -    35 a time in a phone shop to get a new screen especially as they insist they have to fit it. But it is simple to fit if you fancy a go yourself.Fascia s are everywhere so there s a large variety of them for this phone, usually around    10 -    15 a time. Good to jazz up your phone, and you can match them with some great accesories like flashing keypads. Although the keypads once fitted have to be taken back to the shop to be taken off again. So unless you like constant flashing probably not a good idea. there are literally thousands or ringtones and logos for this phone and unlike the newer Nokia s this phone has a composer so you can usually get keypad presses off the internet and put the tones in yourself for free. But if that sounds like hard work you can pay for them, either by ringing a premium rate number (usually about    1.50 a min for 3 mins) or you can now buy a card like a top up card (prices vary) and the newest way is by sms.On call register you can see what calls you ve made and recieved and at what time and day. There are 5 games and you can join club nokia and send your high scores to the internet.

5096868::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::01.11.2001::::    I like to be an individual since almost *everyone* has got a 3310, i would generally would just rule it outbut the question has to be asked *why* has everyone got one, is it because its just stylish like a 500 pound pair of shoes?Fortunatly no, the Nokia 3310 is so effective as a product because it is *good*It looks goodIt feels goodand it works good (damn that bad english)ok... it works *well*I think the main feature that makes it better than other phones is it is the display is graphically nice, now im not sure if i am allowed to critise other phones but phones like.. an ericsonn t10 has a long, thin display, that, even at the best times, looks messy.The nokia however has such a large display that is crisp, that it is a pleasure to look atAs a result of this the nokia can display much more things than other phones, such as pretty graphics, and like they say, a picture paints a thousand words. This makes the large display a big advantageAnother major advantage in my opinion, is the feel of the phone, you can grip it, and it feels nice, and the click of the buttons beneath your figures is.........satisfyingEnough of the outside, the strucure of the inside is also superlativethe phone has many features that, although not crucial to making calls just make the phone be more desirable, such as the alarm clock. and quickly get rid of boredom with fun, and addictive games.About the games: since you get a score, which is recorded in your phone and lots of people have this phone its something easy to talk about, great icebreaker at parties :  hello good looking, whats your highscore on snake unlike other phones it doesnt have many buttons, but still remains effective and increases the ease of useother advantages are>>it is robust, --- there are no extruding parts, so nothing can snap off>>the reception is good --- the earpeice sound is full and rich>>its got a full range of features>>the battery lasts a long timehmm time for a disadvantage......i think this one is obvious.... EXPENSIVEhere though, is the main question: is it worth it? in my opinion, no, its around the 100 pound mark and i could do so much better things with that money but think of it this way -----a lesser phone would cost 50 pound3310 includes a alarm clock (which cost about 10 pounds)you look cool with it (variable rating for yourself)discuss games to with other people (variable rating for yourself)and more...so, including those factors, does the total value come to more than its price.... it will for some people, for others it wontdecide for yourself////////Opinion by the_kiwi - dedicated to writing informative concise opinions     ::::5889:2:::5091531:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5092881:3:::19093:3:::19093:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5096508:3:::5096508:3:::5085331:3:::10438:3:::5085430:3:::5085666:4:::5085666:4:::5091135:4:::5091135:4:::</endperson>

14110::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::21.02.2001::::    Sorry about the title but I had to get your attention and tell you about this.This little beaut. is pretty much everything it is cracked up to be, boy was my gadget-mad brother jealous when he saw I had a 3310; he thought his 3210 was the best  To be honest, the phone chose me, BT gave it to me along with some extras when I changed my call plan. This raises an interesting point though; it does seem that the majority of Nokia 3310 phones that I have come across tend to use BT Cellnet or vodaphone as their service providers, with the schoolkid-brain-frying Orange next. Maybe a coincidence, maybe Cellnet is on a roll.As the man said the phone has so many features that you are almost guaranteed not to use them all. This is a moot point however as I would have liked to have had more than 5 voice-activated dialling options and maybe the variety could have been toned down to increase the quality. As for the games; it is great to see the African game they call  Bantumi  (I know it as  Awari ) there. This game can be as complex as chess and will suit the more, shall we say mature? No, let s say sophisticated, user. All in, an excellent example of 3rd generation tech. and a taste of things to come. PS did I mention the incredible messaging options, pity many other mobi s aren t up to accepting them         ::::23574:2:::23574:2:::5001498:2:::5003636:3:::5001532:3:::</endperson>

The phone is hardwearing you can drop it a few times and it doesn t break. The phone also still works if you drop it in water, but don t try it.The games on nokia are great when you need to kill time. It s hard although not to get addicted to playing them.The Nokia booklet that comes with the phone is also very handy espicaly if it s your first phone or even first Nokia phone.The 3310 is very stylish and very popular, if you don t like the colour it s easy to change.There aren t many things that are bad with this phone.When I first got mine I had problems turning it off because the off button was hard to press. You soon get the hang of it though.

5344924::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::30.05.2003::::    Nokia 3310, a compact, stylish phone with features such as voice mail and text messaging. It comes with 4 games (space impact, snake II, bantumi and pairs II) and loads of ringtones with space for more. As the 3310 is a very commonly bought phone, there is a wide selection of things available to buy for it, such as phone covers, handsfree sets, ringtones, stickers for your phone which are removed easily without leaving a mark, logos and picture messages which are all quite simple to use.  These are available to but without you spending          , you can get the covers from as little as    1   One of the features, found on other phones, which the 3310 does NOT have is a colour screen, it would be great and is seen on the newer nokia models. It also does not have a Joystick, but hey, beggars cant be choosers and, like the screen, it can be found on later models.It is quite a light phone, although you are aware that it is there either in your pocket or in its case. The battery life lasts quite a while and it only takes a few minutes to charge back up. It comes with a small charger and you can buy in-car phone chargers for it.Overall, it is a great phone and I would reccommend it to anyone.     ::::5350344:2:::5350344:2:::5342688:2:::5342688:2:::5284267:2:::5284267:2:::3343:2:::3343:2:::5202189:2:::5202189:2:::5317988:3:::5317988:3:::5348863:3:::5348863:3:::5245206:3:::5245206:3:::5269918:3:::5126903:3:::5240190:3:::5240548:3:::5309690:3:::5001428:3:::5001428:3:::5257997:3:::</endperson>

5412903::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::05.12.2004::::    This fone was fantastic and still is great but o course as time goes by things become extinct eg. B+W TV s. But when this fone first came out it was obviously the best fone on the market with the best value for money. Anyone would have been a fool not to buy it. But now as there are colour fones with internet and cameras no-one will give a second thought to this fone. My advice to you though is don t overlook it because it is very reliable. My new fone (Motorola V500 which I have written a review on by the way) is not very reliable at all but it has much better functions such as camera etc. but the 3310 never let you dwn. It took about 10 seconds to turn it on and to be speaking to someone. The SIM card was very good then. Also once you plug the charger in it was immediatly charging.

Also it never once froze or took time for it to react to a command such as entering text at a high speed. the functions that the fone did have were: gamesremindersalarm calculatorstopwatchpicture messagestext messagescalls of courseetcOverall it was a fantastic fone which I would have strongly erged you to buy 2 years ago but right now you would jusat be wasting your money     ::::5769137:2:::5769137:2:::5439465:2:::5439465:2:::5466002:2:::5065876:2:::5065876:2:::5014851:2:::5014851:2:::5326039:2:::5386276:2:::5386276:2:::5065833:2:::5996591:3:::5996591:3:::6174730:3:::6174730:3:::5469307:3:::5487912:3:::5595008:3:::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5382867:3:::5465910:3:::5465910:3:::5584168:3:::5276833:3:::5276833:3:::5241292:3:::5241292:3:::5521976:3:::5472775:3:::5247778:3:::5247778:3:::5580589:3:::5580589:3:::</endperson>

5126822::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::21.11.2001::::    *********************UPDATE********************29/07/02My phone is still going strong, and I love it, however i may be replacing it for an 8310, I ll wait and see The first thing that strikes you about the Nokia 3310 is the size and weight of the mobile. It fits snugly in your pocket, but be warned, after a while you forget it is there as it is so light.The handset is excellently designed, and to minimise the size it has an internal aerial. The battery fits in very nicely and it doesn   t move around     my previous phone (5110) wasn   t very well designed and within months the battery became very loose resulting in spontaneous power cuts. On the 3310 the battery holds the Siam card in place, so nothing becomes loose. Ten out of ten for design    There are many features of the Nokia 3310; here I will show everything to know about the phone.ADDRESS BOOKThe address book is used to store phone numbers. After they have been added you can search through whenever you need to and call that person with a single touch of a button. Depending on the sim card, you can store between 100 and 250 names and numbers. Another function of the address book is that you can assign ringtones to different people, so you know who is ringing before you even pick up the phone. The 3310 is also voice activate, so you can record different voice messages for different people. (Use voice dialling by holding the enter button.) Probably the handiest thing about this function is speed dialling, in which you activate your most used numbers to a button. (E.g. 1=Home, 2=Barry etc.)  MESSAGESThe most in thing to do now days on a mobile phone is text messaging. Depending again on which network you are on, you can store between 5-20 messages in your inbox, and 5-20 messages in your outbox. A new feature for the 3310 is the template, which you can add if you feel you are constantly writing the same thing to different people. There is also a    smileys    section so you can express your mood in only 3 characters. (E.g. ;-),   61514;,   61516;  )When writing a message you can use predictive text, which is very useful after some practice at using it. Instead of hitting the buttons up to 4 times for a single letter, predictive text lets you hit them only once, and guesses which word you mean. It also gives you a list of other less likely words. Extremely unique and useful function. The 3310 is also compatible with picture messages, so you can download or get sent up to 15 picture messages. CHATA new feature to Nokia is the chat mode, where you can text message another person in a chat room type of format. This is a very good idea, but expensive unless you have free text messages. (If your network is Genie or similar.)CALL REGISTERThe call register option tells you up to 20 dialled numbers, received calls and call durations, as well as missed calls. This is a very common feature among Nokia phones but very useful if you need to check something. TONESRingtones have become very popular over the last year or so, and the 3310 lets you download or compose 7 of your own, aswell as the 35 which are already on there. You can also choose your text message alert tone and the volume of your rings.  Composer is the most creative part of the whole phone, as it allows you to make your own tones using various notes/pitch/length. You can also select whether you want vibration alert on or off, and keypad tones on or off. A new property of the 3310 is the screensavers. Before you could only have a downloaded logo, but now you can use your picture messages which parade the screen after a selectable time limit.SETTINGSThis is useful if you need to change anything about you phone, including: automatic redial, speed dialling, own number sending, language, network selection, pin code request and call barring among other things. All of these services are pretty self-explanatory. If your phone went wrong you can also restore it to its factory settings, aslong, as you know the security code.CALL DIVERTCall divert is very useful if you are busy. You can divert it to you voicemail or another number with a number of other properties. GAMESThe most addictive part of the phone is the games. There are 4 games;SNAKE II     9 different speeds for beginners or experts, and 5 different but equally crazy mazes. The object of snake is to make your snake grow longer by eating the bits of food. My top score on this is 2356, as I found a kind of tactic     complete the game on slower levels by filling up the screen, and progress on the levels after beating your previous score.SPACE IMPACT     This is a copy of the retro game, which back in the day was the start of an era. You guide around a space ship through various levels defeating different aliens, with a    boss    at the end of each level. My top score on this is 9555, but I hardly ever play it as after a while it gets very repetitive.PAIRS II     The simple but addictive concept of memorising different cards and matching them with their pair. You can either do a time trial or puzzle, but each stage gets progressively harder. BANTUMI     The ancient game with foreign origins. Each player has to collect the most peas into their main pot. After much practice and thinking, I soon realised how to play the game. Currently I can complete level 3 of 5. There are other options which you can use with the game including lights, vibrations and sound.CALCULATORSelf-explanatory really. It can deal with up to 9 figures, and adds, subtracts, multiplies and divides.You can also convert currency, which is extremely useful when going abroad. REMINDERSIn the reminders section you can write in up to 35 characters of anything. Personally, I use reminders for good websites that I come across, but you can use it as a diary or organiser, as it has a built in alarm. CLOCKApart from telling you the time and date, it also gives you the opportunity to use an alarm clock, stopwatch or countdown timer. PROFILESProfiles are a variety of different settings, and tones. You can have a personal one, as well as loud, silent (for meetings etc.) and discreet as well as a few more.The Nokia series are simply the best as they are so easy to use. The 3310 is definitely the easiest I have come across. Useful notes for the 3310. To lock/unlock the keypad press enter, followed by star * . To find your serial number press * 06 Use shortcuts to save time. (E.g. To get to snake to press enter, 8, 1. It will take you to the Snake II menu )In conclusion, if anyone were indecisive about which phone to buy, I would recommend to anyone the Nokia 3310.     ::::5327467:3:::5327467:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5239945:4:::23544:4:::18116:4:::5238961:4:::5238961:4:::5202843:4:::5202056:4:::5077810:4:::5026033:4:::10201:4:::5085331:4:::3338:4:::3338:4:::5091531:4:::5091767:4:::5091135:4:::5091135:4:::5093223:4:::5001880:4:::5066688:4:::5066688:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5012563:4:::</endperson>

15157::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::22.02.2001::::    After having broken the aerial off my old, chunky mobile, I was eager to buy a more compact, durable, and (of course) stylish phone. It was with all this in mind that I bought the Nokia 3310. Buying this phone didn t just give me a more up-to-date piece of equipment, it also made me part of a community. Perhaps the best thing about having a Nokia is being able to  join the club  and receive operator logos, ring tones, etc. And what s more with the 3310, you can compose your own tunes should you ever get bored from everything available. Speaking of boredom, the 3310 has the best selection of fun games I have ever seen. Test your skill on the addictive Snake II, blast aliens on Space Impact, plot the downfall of your opponent on Bantumi, and try your patience with Pairs - the 3310 is much more than a phone, it s a handheld entertainment s unit The other reason that I am so keen on the 3310 is that it is totally personalisable. There is a whole range of different covers on offer to alter the phone at your discretion. Along with style, such a feature as interchangeable front and back covers serves to keep the phone looking brand new, should the current case succumb to stratching, etc. There is a great deal going for the Nokia 3310, which makes it a leader in its field. Nokia have obviously taken their time to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages of the 3210 and have made the necessary improvements. For example, the 3210 lacked a vibrating alert function, and that improvement has been added to the 3310, even to the extent of the games vibrating So much more than just a phone, the 3310 excels in every field.      ::::5309724:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5001532:3:::5016866:3:::5017954:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::</endperson>

5013173::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::10.03.2001::::    I bought the 3310 a few months ago just before Christmas, having the 5510 and not being happy with it in the slightest. What made me want to get this phone, that fact that it was small and slim and had a vibrating alert was one of my main incentives, plus the Games that came with it J. I was very happy when I first got the phone opening it up before I even got out of the shop looking at all the different features that I could have. Now having the 3310 on Pay As You Go Tariff, brings down all of the functions you can actually get on your phone. Such as you are unable to use the phone abroad and you do not have Call Waiting. Something all girls need as they are forever talking on the phone.However the functions that can be found on the 3310 for a Pay As You Go phone is as follows:1)PhonebookWithin the phonebook you have all the simple features that you are able to find within all phones, these are Search, Add Name, Erase, Edit, Options and Speed Dial. The extra features, which I have yet to come across within a phone before is, Assign Tone, Send Business Card, and Voice Tag.Now Assign Tone I think is very handy as it allows you to pick a certain ring for a particular number, for example I have Auld lang syne for my boyfriend, so I know before I look at the phone that he is ringing. This is very good if you don  8217;t like a particular person but they are forever phoning you can tell before picking up the phone who they are.Send Business Card is another feature that I have yet to come across this, sends your name and number of your mobile phone to anyone you want. This is a better way then texting everyone to say you have a new phone it is quick and simple.Voice Tag is a feature I have yet to see on Pay As You Go phones, as I know that you are able to get them on Contract Phones. This feature is simple you all you need to do is create a voice tag, and save it to the number. Then old down the menu button and say the voice tag and it will automatically dial the number. The only problem I have had with this is that you have to say it exactly the same way each time otherwise it does not recognize the name.2) MessagesWithin Messages you can find the usual sets of features such as Write Message, Inbox, Outbox, Templates, and Message Settings. However there are a few extra ones within Messages also these are Picture Messages and Smileys.Picture Messages is where you can send and receive picture messages between your phone and other phones which use picture messaging. For anyone who does not know what pictures you can have they can range from Birthday Cakes, to Hearts, to Flowers. This feature is quite good if you want to wish someone Happy Birthday or say you Love them.Smileys are collection of characters that are used to represent a mood, abbreviate a sentiment or a use as a signature. The phone contains four preset smileys that you can edit, as well as room for three smileys of your own.3) ChatThis feature is allows you to have a conversation with another person using text messages. It allows you to read messages that have already been sent. This feature is quite good although you can forget how much money you do send as it costs the same as a text message.4) Call RegisterThis feature as all the usually features as other phones with no extras thrown in, the features are Missed Calls, Received Calls, Dialled Numbers, Erase Recent call lists, Show call duration, and Prepaid Credit.5) TonesThis feature has some extra features within it, that can  8217;t be found on PAUG (Pay As You Go) phones, but can be found on contract. The usual features, which can be found on all PAUG phones are Ring Tones, Ring Volume, Incoming Call Alert, Message Alert Tone, Keypad Tones, Warning Tones. The extra features are Composer, Vibrating Alert, and Screen Savers.Composer allows you to make up your own ring tones or download them from the Internet. You have the space to put on four tones of your choice.Vibrating Alert is a feature, which allows your phone to vibrate when a message is sent or a call is being received.Screen Savers are a feature which places a picture on your phone when it is not being used you can chose from a choice of 15 different screensavers, also saying how long the phone has to be not in use before the Screen Saver pops up, it is like a computer screensaver.6) SettingsThis feature is no different from any other phone with features such as Call Settings, Phone Settings, Security Settings, and Restore Factory Settings.7) GamesThere are four new games on here which are very fun to play you have Snake 2, Space Impact, Bantumi, and Pairs 2. These games are a fun way to pass time while bored or waiting for someone.8) CalculatorThis feature explains itself.9) RemindersThis is like an alarm clock, which goes off with a written message to remind you have a certain date, or something that needs to be done.10) ClockThis is the same feature, which is found on all phones and needs little explanation11) ProfilesThis feature has the different states that your phone can be in such as General, Silent, Discreet, Loud and My Style.Overall I think this phone is great and I have had little problems with it and I should recommend this phone to anyone that is looking for a new phone, if I had any complaint it would that it was too small and you could lose it if you were not careful.     ::::5030752:2:::5001374:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5027359:4:::5000806:4:::5016866:4:::5019505:4:::5000818:4:::5000728:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::5003083:4:::5003083:4:::17947:4:::17947:4:::5012948:4:::5012948:4:::5001532:4:::5012426:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::</endperson>

5003684::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::18.01.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 could keep you occupied for hours. I only purchased mine last Friday and I definitely didn  8217;t regret it. Most networks are offering this phone free subject to a 12-month contract. I had the Nokia 402 and this is on another planet.  It has many features which compete with other top phones, such as Speed dialing, Voice dialing, Picture messaging, vibrating alert, chat messaging and 4 great games. The games itself will keep you entertained throughout any journey, especially when you are delayed for hours on the train You can make this phone unique by creating your own personal ring tone in the Composer function. You can also download tones and logos from the Internet, from sites like Yourmobile, IOBox, etc. You can also buy express covers to change the style on your mobile for around    20 each. Although the selection available is currently limited soon enough there will be millions of different styles. This phone only takes a couple of hours to charge and from this you get You can also use the reminder function, which allows you to type in a note of something you have to do. You can then set an alarm to go off at any time you like to remind you to this task.The list of things this phone does is endless. It is the best phone I have had or used and I would recommend it to anyone.The games are Snake II, Space Impact, Bantumi and Pairs II. Many people will know what Pairs and Snake is from previous Nokia phones, although these versions are much more advanced and give you many more options. Space Impact reminds you of those times as a kid at the local arcade shooting away at the enemies. As for Bantumi, I haven  8217;t quite mastered it yet, but by what I am aware you have to compete against the phones to see who can put the most beans into the pot.If you are considering which handset to go for the Nokia 3310 is an excellent choice.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::18021:3:::18021:3:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5202843:4:::5018158:4:::5000931:4:::5013991:4:::23544:4:::23316:4:::5003492:4:::5003492:4:::5001532:4:::22607:4:::13861:4:::13861:4:::</endperson>

Pictures may be used from the phones memory or they may be downloaded via a PC or telephone service (   1 per min).Ring tones can also be downloaded from the Internet and phone services as well as enabling the user to compose their own tune.The phone is small, sleek and fashionable.  The absence of the aerial is a great advantage and does not effect the phones reception.To turn the phone on the user must press a neat   8220;flat  8221; rubber button at the top of the phone.  It  8217;s one of those buttons with a nice feel when you press it, you sometimes don  8217;t have to press it, but you have to because it feels nice  Know what I mean? HeheThe Nokia 3310 features voice activated dialling   8211; Just say the name and it dial  8217;s   When I first seen this feature I didn  8217;t think it would work very well but, it work very well indeed.The user may choose from a large variety of ring tones, most of which are quite good.  Different ring tones can be assigned to different people, so you know who is calling As well as the ring tones the user can choose the vibrating alert.Lets not forget the games  The phone features 4 games you can pay whilst bored on the bus or train.  Games include   8220;Snake 2  8221;     8220;Space Impact  8221;.  Each game starts with it  8217;s own little title screen, just like a computer game.

5021594::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::13.04.2001::::    I have had the 3310 about three weeks now and have so far been very impressed.  It is so far the best mobile phone that i have owned and in my oppinion the best of the nokia range   It even beats the 8210 by miles for features.So, you may ask.  What makes the 3310 so good?firstly nokia have introduced the  chat  feature on the 3310.  This enables two people to send text messages to each other in an internet chat type fashion.  This saves on time and avoids the hastle of emptying your inbox all the time because when you have finished chat the conversation gets erased.  This for me is the best feature.The 3310 also has great games.  The best of which is snake 2.  The new improved snake 2 has different mazes and the phone also vibrates when the player picks up a token.  Another of its great games is  space impact .  This is a game where the player is a spaceship and is aiming to destroy the enemie spacecraft The sound quality of the 3310 matches the quality of the fatures.  Excellent   The phone holds signal well and is always crystal clear.The phone is aimed at students who want a feature packed mobile with attitude and the phone delivers this.  It is currently retailing at    99.99 and well worth it. I bought it from the carphonewarehouse on there own pay as you go tariff, Value Telecom fresh.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5002639:3:::2998:3:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5020891:4:::5020891:4:::5020769:4:::</endperson>

18553::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::05.01.2001::::    I have alway bought Nokia phones because they are very reliable and don t break easily. I have droped mine many times and it still works like new. If you do break it (by cracking the cover or screen) you can simply buy a new cover for about    10 so you don t have to buy a new phone. There are many designs of phone covers to choose from. On this model, you can change the front and back cover of the phone. There are few things that I don t particulaly like about the 3310 but they are all very minor. At the bottom of the phone, the covers overlap off the end of the phone slightly. Also, when you plug in a hands free set, it doesn t say headset on the front so the only way you can tell if you ve plugged it in correctly is to test is by ringing it.The last thing that I don t like is the fact that if you put your phone on silent, the vibrator doesn t work so to have the phone on silent but still have the vibrator working, you must switch all the tones off seperately which takes time.On this phone, you can program in your own profiles so if you share your phone with other people, you can each have your own profile so you can have your personalised settings for ring tones, volume etc.It also has a vibrating alert and voice activation.I may have written more about the bad points about this phone but that s only because I would be here all day if I wrote all the good points.This is an excelent phone that everybody should have it.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5035604:3:::5001374:3:::5002171:3:::5092922:4:::20081:4:::4665:4:::18594:4:::1315:4:::5002622:4:::5002540:4:::</endperson>

5026265::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::10.05.2001::::    The latest phone from Nokia   8211; it  8217;s small, light, thin, and pretty much like the 3210, 6210, 5110 and all other Nokia phones    Apart from the size etc  8230; there is no real difference between the 3310 and the other Nokia phones, however, there are some unique features, which I will mention as we go on.  As I scroll through the main menu, this is what I find  8230;~Phone Book~The phone book on the 3310 can hold well over 100 numbers, and you have a choice of how you display the, with name, number, name and number.  This of course is entirely up to your personal preference, although I prefer the dual option myself.  There is the ability to assign a certain ring tone to different people, for example when the boss calls the funeral march could play, and when your partner phones, Ode To Joy could play (if you like that sort of thing)   Another unique feature is that you can assign a voice tag to a name, meaning that instead of trawling through the phone book, you can just say the name of the person you want to call into the handset and it will dial it automatically.  ~Messages or SMS~This is a pretty standard feature throughout phones nowadays, although the 3310 has predictive text input, which means instead of pressing each key multiple times to get your desired kletter, just press it once, and it will try and guess the word you are spelling, cuts down the time it takes by about 80     You can also send picture messages, smilies and use templates, i.e.   8216;Ring me at home  8230;  8217;.  Text messages usually cost between 10p-12p, depending what network you are on.~Chat~This is basically no more than live text messaging between two phones, expensive and slow.~Call Register~This section of the phone can show you any missed calls, the time you have spent on the phone, your received calls, numbers you have dialled, your prepaid credit (if applicable).  This is useful for billing purposes, or if you are concerned about how much time you spend on the phone.~Tones~This is the major selling point of any phone   8211; the number of ringing melodies it has, the 3310 has about 30, with 5 spaces in which you can either download tones from the net, or compose your own.  This means you have a virtually limitless choice of tones   There are 5 ringing volumes, which is handy for different situations, as well as vibrating   8211; for when you don  8217;t want to be disturbed.  You can also choose the incoming SMS tone and keypad volume etc  8230;~Settings~In this section you can customise your phone, for example your hotkey numbers, redial, network, time and date, language, welcome messages  security (i.e. PIN number) etc  8230;  This is useful especially on contract phone so that people can  8217;t use your phone if you loose it.~Call Divert~This provides the option for the automatic diversion of your calls if you don  8217;t answer them, i.e. to your home phone or answer machine.  However, this service often fails, and I never use it.~Games~This is really a gimmik, but entertaining nonetheless, especially when your stuck on the tube or a train   There are 4 games to choose from, including an updated Snake game that was on other Nokias.  These game are enjoyable and easy to play   8211; not to taxing like Tomb Raider.  The graphics, considering the screen are quite good, and the make best use of different fonts etc  8230;~Calculator~A basic calculator function (+*-/), no scientific functions though   8211; which could be useful if you suddenly need to work out the angle of a triangle.~Reminders~This is where you can schedule alarms and reminders for yourself, which is useful if you are forgetful like me.~Clock~Here you can also set the time, and date, as well as specifiy your date/time format, i.e. 12/24 hour clock.That is it for the menus, however  8230;~Ease of Use~All the buttons can be accessed by the thumb of the hand you are holding the phone in, which is good if you are carrying something.  Also the menus are very easy to use, with one button to select thing, and a up/down button to move through the menus.  ~Price~There are two price options with this phone, depending whether you buy it on a contract (billed monthly) or pre-pay, where you buy vouchers of credit   8211; which you replace when you run out.  The contract version if free, but you have to pay    15-   20 line rental a month + call charges and so is not as cheap as it looks.  However, on pay-as-you-go, the phone costs    80-   120, depending again on which operator you choose.  If you already have the 3210 on pre-pay there really is no point in upgrading, unless you want the extra games and voice dialling ~Overall~The phone is sleek, sexy and lightweight, perfect for the trendsetter.  It has a huge variety of functions, although it doesn  8217;t have WAP which at    100, it should have.  The reception is generally good, and battery life is 2-3 days, if you only talk a bit.  However, the phone is expensive on PAYG, so think carefully about other options on the market.  For example the Trium Mars    40, has most of the features on the 3310 + WAP    Oh, and you can also get changable covers  9/10     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5025695:4:::5025695:4:::2998:4:::5026428:4:::5022480:4:::5022480:4:::5026771:4:::10438:4:::</endperson>

10234::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::10.01.2001::::    The 3310 is quite a large improvement on the Nokia 3210 despite the amazing similarity in appearance. The picture messages have been beefed up quite significantly, and the choice of games is a vast improvement on any of the other Nokia models - Snake II is a nice improvement on the original with mazes spicing up the gameplay significantly. Also the space invaders clone is quite entertaining, and bantumi is one of the best mobile telephone strategy games that I have seen so far. The best thing about this choice of 3 games is that they all offer something different, and each person must be able to derive a lot of fun from at least one of them. The vibrate function is impressive, reception is good, and battery life is good also - and combined with everyday50 and telco this is in my opinion the best deal around at the moment aside from there being no WAP capability.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5016598:3:::5013849:3:::11980:3:::13365:3:::5001532:3:::5015050:4:::5002776:4:::8958:4:::</endperson>

5372514::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::26.08.2003::::    I have gone through so many different phones in the past couple of years and they have all been a nightmare for me to work out how to use but when I got my Nokia 3310, which is probably rather dated now, I found it easy to use and have had a lot of fun working out its functions.I never in the past bothered much about playing games on my mobile or getting the latest cool ringtones but this phone has opened doors for me and I am happy to say I have experimented with it a bit.It is fairly small and fits easily in the palm of my hand it is also a handy size for your pocket. It has a vibrating function which I found ingenious as I could never hear my other phones ringing when I was in busy crowded places but now I feel it vibrate in my pocket so I know it is ringing even if I have not heard it. It has about 40 built in ringtones and empty spaces to add your own which can be obtained through calling a premium number or composing your own through the phone, that part has taken me a bit longer to master and most of my composed tones sound a bit strange but never mind cos as they say practice makes perfect. You can send text messages a lot easier with this phone as it has a thing called T9 text which means you hit the letters of the words you want to use and the phone sorts the word out for you pretty natty huh. I got my phone second hand for about    60 but it is probably a heck of a lot cheaper now and I am sure you can get it free if you take out a contract on it which I never done because I prefer pay as you go. I have had lots of different facias (covers) on it as they are interchangeable and they make my phone look totally new each time I change them. It has been the bst phone I have had, great reception, lots of phonebook space to store numbers and easy access to them when you need to make a call.  It also features an on screen balance at the end of each call which is really good as you never wonder how much credit you have left and never need to fall short and run out of credit during a call. My favourite game on it was snake but now I am fairly bored with it and have killed off many brain cells playing it.It is a brilliant little phone and only needs a couple of hours charging, I think I will stick with it for the time being and perhaps get a newer model when they become a litle cheaper.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5373984:3:::5338333:4:::5203155:4:::5203155:4:::5348863:4:::5348863:4:::5335750:4:::5353517:4:::5372794:4:::5372794:4:::5331868:4:::5331868:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::5247778:4:::5247778:4:::5349970:4:::5353033:4:::</endperson>

5020426::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::15.04.2001::::    What you will have already noticed is this phone looks dinky and cool    It s an extremly compact phone which fits easily into a pocket. This is especially helpful if you wear jeans because it doesn t stick out as much, so will be better concealed from potential thieves and won t make you look like a prat, well not for that reason. Thes setup is very familiar for all Nokia users and is simple to learn if you are a newbie. The games are back and better than ever. There is the usual timewasters but in particular Snake 2 and a rip-off of Space Invaders. There is a 90 number phone book and you can also store 8 Voice activated numbers. Trouble is it can be a bit dodgy if you aren t alone as the name needs to be said exactly the same as it was recorded this can mean you spend more time than if you just searched for it  There are plenty of annoying ringtones and you can get even more by downloading off the internet: www.yourmobile.com is a good place to start. The newest feature is chat, which is like when you are in a chatroom but you send text messages instead of typing. This is actually a bit of a rip-off because you are paying for each message which can soon add up  You re better off in a net chatroom. Speaking of the text messeges, they are still as popular as ever and you can now use more characters per message. It also has predictive text like its big brother the 3210. However personally i find this irritating and end up wanting to turn it off at times. It can b annoying if u r writing txt in shorthand u know what i mean :) NEWSFLASHHowever, being picky as i am i have decided to sell it for a tidy sum. I still prefer my Sony CMD Z5 - it has that unique quality. Coincidently I have written an opinion on that too ;-) It proves how popular the 3310 is because I sold it in no time.Overall, its a great lickle phone and is very popular (perhaps too common) the only other thing that bugs me is the buttons which are small and hard, which can be annoying especially if you have a cover/case. I saw this as a decent little phone as I had a very good deal for it. It is worth getting, because it is aesthetically (long word, huh?) pleasing you will be able to get a good resell price.Thanks for reading this op - feel free to drop a comment=MMUK=     ::::5311781:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5301118:3:::5001498:3:::5013036:3:::5013036:3:::5022909:3:::5065833:4:::5002378:4:::5002378:4:::5000728:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5016246:4:::19331:4:::18434:4:::18557:4:::18557:4:::5013095:4:::5013095:4:::5014365:4:::5014365:4:::23074:4:::5013088:4:::5001374:4:::5020891:4:::5020891:4:::5000858:4:::5000858:4:::16615:4:::18388:4:::</endperson>

5003019::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::01.02.2001::::    Since I know Nokia 3310, I always think: what should they imagine next? Feels like there s no feature a phone cannot perform and a 3310 cannot fulfill. Nokia has always been a very  clever phone doing the things the others cannot do, but this time it looks like it has accumulated all the possible features from the other ones. This phone has got a wide range of usual Nokia-like tricks e.g. moving pictures, phone dialogs, sending postcards and recieving tones from the Internet. This time, in spite of being able to record or compose 8 ringtones, the phone has got a vibracall (a very necessary feature for some types of occcupations, I know people who refused to buy any Nokias because of not having a vibracall) and a voice dial. In spite of voice dial being very sensitive and power-consuming, this feature is also necessary while driving or just being in a hurry.A 3310 model shows the incredible possibility range for a reasonable price. It can be found for an approximate price of 190   in our local stores.     ::::23574:3:::23574:3:::18021:3:::18021:3:::9435:3:::5011961:4:::</endperson>

5347811::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::08.06.2003::::    The Nokia 3310 is an exceptional mobile phone and is one of the most popular hand sets ever manufactured. The main hightlight of the phone is its simplicity. You are not inundated with millions of tones, which you really wouldn`t get round to using. The buttons aren`t so small that you need a sharpened tooth- pick to operate. You will find that the Nokia 3310 is compatible with most ringtones, logos and picture messages. However the Nokia 3310 cannot accept screensavers, photos or polyphonic ringtones but do you really need these?The Nokia 3310 is an excellent phone which is perfect for teenagers who want a taste of picture messages, logos and ringtones. I would not suggest this phone for the avid communication whizz. The phone can be bought at a reasonable price and does a reasonable amount of neat tricks. Perfect for a first time buyer.      ::::5250720:2:::5250720:2:::5345556:2:::5345556:2:::5240548:3:::5323849:3:::10438:3:::</endperson>

5347665::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::04.09.2003::::    The Look I think that the Nokia is very good looking and it the basic cover is light blue with silver buttons. Weight and SizeThe nokia is quite heavy when compared to other phones but it a very good pocket sized and it fits into smal handbags.Using the PhoneI think that the Nokia is very easy to use and it is very self explanatory to use and all the nokias are basically the same. The buttons are the right size and everything is easy to pick up.  The BatteryThe battery on a nokia is quite long but like most mobiles it depends on how much you use it. If you use it a lot and play the games all the time then the battery lasts about 3 days. If you dont use your phone a lot then it can last from 4 to 6 days. ReceptionThe reception that you get all depends on the tariff that you are with. but generally you get good network coverage with it.this phone does not hav colour screen or video messaging...     ::::5262824:2:::5334775:2:::5334775:2:::5014851:2:::5014851:2:::</endperson>

The 3310 is also good for quality talktime, battery does not die quickly, exciting and interesting to use   Stylish and a very sexy phone, makes you look good   Voice dialing is gr8 for looking up your peeps quickly, and the composer, you cabn receive ringtones which is a must these days   You can store up to 8 ringtones, compose your own tones.

14485::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::24.04.2001::::    i acquired my brand spanking new Nokia 3310 on the upgrade system which means that even though I bought it, I didn t really. You see Nokia bought back my 3210 for    20 after which I bought my 3310 for    20-good swap  The buy back money then comes off my next bill, making my next payment about    0.Anyway onto the phone itself. It s roughly the same size as the 3210 if a little bit podgier. Like a 3210 that ate all the pies  The buttons have been rounded a bit more on the edges and made to look more streamlined. The 3310 has all the same features of its little brother the 3210 plus a few more for your enjoyment. New features include a chat facility and although I haven t used this yet it seems very much like having a chat via text yet under a different menu heading. Although a bonus may be that you can look at a chat history with a person and dish the dirt to all your mates.screensavers are also new. They work in much the same way as on a computer; a little picture appears when you haven t pressed anything for a few seconds. You can also programme different profiles. For example you can have a different set of volumes and ringtone for when you re in work to when you re at home. There are more ringtones and space for about 7 or 8 more.You would think voice dialling to be a bonus, but unless you say the name in the exact same way as you recorded it, it will not find it. It can seem a fun novelty at first but it s sometimes quicker to search for the name.A reminders menu can programme the phone to beep at a certain time on a certain day. So far I ve used it to remind me that Eastenders is on The new games are an obvious bonus. No more will we spend hours trying to match up cards in Memory, now we get to match up cards in Pairs  Snake 2 and Space Impact are definite bonuses for the discerning student. Can anyone give me a cheat for Bantumi-I never win Changeable feront and back covers mean you can funk up the phone and although it s meant to be the new improved 3210 it feels a lot less sturdy. The casing and buttons feel a bit more plastic than the 3210.Overall it s a streamlined, attractive phone with good new features that make it seem as though Nokia really listens to public opinion in the improval of its phones.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::2531:3:::2998:3:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5014461:4:::</endperson>

5002585::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::01.04.2001::::       First there was the revolution of pay as you go, the ability to simply buy a top up card and then talk until you run out of credit. Then came the 3210, a slender, bright and light nokia model with 3 games and a range of x-press on covers. Arguably the greatest Nokia model up to that point. Then Nokia released the 3310  A smaller, chunkier, little model with built in vibration and a wider selection of games with more detail. It far surpasses the needs of the regular business man and is aimed more towards the younger generation. It has predictive Text, 4 games, Anti-Radioactive buttons, the ability to store 6 composed ring tones and can store up to 14 picture messages. The only problem being the limited availability on pay as you go. At the moment only Orange offer this option but it is soon to be available on all other networks.           Retail price on Orange pay as you go=   99.99    It gets a Rating of 9 and a half out of 10.     ::::5026309:3:::5019689:3:::5019689:3:::5020891:3:::5020891:3:::23249:3:::23249:3:::5001825:3:::5001825:3:::5228556:4:::</endperson>

5223066::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::14.06.2002::::       The Nokia 3310. Triumph of mobile engineering or a chink in Nokia s mighty armour?      This phone has been around for some time now, and is definitly one of the best on the market. For starters the look and feel of the phone are good. It s not too heavy and the inter-changable fascias are a really good selling point. They can tend to be a bit expensive though, so it s about personal choice really.    It s got nice sizeable keys on the pad, which make for hours of snake induced fun, and is a welcome change if you ve ever tried playing on the miniscule 8210. As a guy with big hands, it s greatly appreciated       The phone s menus are clear and easy to use, and depending on what network you are on, give you a variety of interesting added features, like Virgin extras, or 02 travel, which are specific to the phone. The reminders feature is an especially welcome new feature to nokia phones. It s basically like having as many synchronous alarms as you need, with the added bonus of text reminding you why it s beeping       Other good features include the ability to save up to three profiles, with you own names and levels of noise etc. This is perfect for the different situations in life, i.e quiet for work, loud for home etc.     The Games on offer are Snake 2, Bantumi, Pairs 2, and the superb new offering, Space impact. Like a sideways version of space invaders, you work your way through level after level of alien filled fun  The new version of snake is fun but does little to add to the original. The other two just simply aren t worth bothering with. Sorry, but it s true  On the whole though the games will keep you occupied when you need them to.      A downside to this phone is definitly the durability. The key pad wears out very quickly and the star button (the most important one, as you will find out) has the criminal tendency of being the first to break        The phone also reacts very badly to being dropped or immersed in water, a bad point for anyone clumsy like me  Who remembers the good old Eriksson GA628, which could survive anything? This sadly is not the case for the 3310.      The phone also lacks WAP access, and for all you techheads who can work out how (and why ) to use it, the later 3330, with it s downloadable games might be a better bet.      These downpoints are minor infringements on what is a superb phone, which will serve you well. The 40 pounds increase in price for the slightly better 3330 is not worth it in my opinion. Even after two years on the market it may well still be the best money can buy.   Adam.     ::::5022914:3:::5022914:3:::9435:3:::5186837:3:::5020889:3:::20105:3:::20105:3:::5077810:3:::5202792:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5202697:3:::3447:3:::23074:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5208077:4:::1692:4:::1692:4:::5003505:4:::5003505:4:::5092284:4:::5202843:4:::5002585:4:::5217259:4:::5212402:4:::19093:4:::19093:4:::5207950:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5077305:4:::15440:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::</endperson>

5217815::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::14.06.2002::::    About a year ago i decided to upgrade my Nokia 5510 and choose a newer brand of Nokia phone.I went to the the store and took a look at a few phones and i came across the 3310 which i currently own. Below i have listed all the features and advantages and some disadvantages of this phone if you were on the market looking for a new phone this should assist you in whether you wish to buy a Nokia 3310.The options which are included on the phone are as follows:Phonebook: This allow the user of the phone to add phone numbers of people you wish to add, add voice tags to certain people which you can activate by speaking into the phone, you can send bussiness cards to different people and also assign ringtones to specific callers.Messages: This fuction lets you send messages to anyone else that has a mobile phone. These messages of 160 characters can be send from anywhere but the nokia 3310 allows for up to 549 characters to be sent instead of the standard nokia and other phones. You can also send picture messages and other invoices if you wish to do so.Chat: This fuction is like being on a chat webpage on the internet. With this function you assign nicknames for the people you wish to talk to and instead of sending messages you can have a chat with up to 5 people.Call Register: This allows the user to check who they have called, who has called them, the duration of each call, call cost and other small functions which could assist you or track down any missed calls.Tones: This handy feature allows the user to assign a ringtone to the phone so if anyone rings the ringtone will be played therefore the user being able to hear it and answer it. There are 6 free spaces for users to download or compose new ringtones if you wish to add some.Settings: This feature lets the user play around with the phone. You can change different kind of settings which include the phone settings, call settings, security settings and factory settings. With the settings feature you are able to change the language of the phone to your prefered language if its available.You can also change you password for your phone so if one day your phone gets stolen no one will be able to use it without your personal password that you will place on it.Call Divert: The handy option if your mobile is switched off or you are in a business meeting. This option lets you divert your calls to another number which then could be answered therefore you not missing any important calls.Games: The fun feature of the phone lets the user  chill out  and enjoy being a kid again. The games such as Snake 2, Pairs 2, Space Impact and Bantumi could keep you occupied for hours.Calculator: Another handy feature if you want to add some numbers or multiply some hard equation if you cant do it in your head. This feature has all the standard mathematical options and is easy to operate.Reminder: Ever missed a birthday or a business meeting? Stop worrying as the Nokia 3310 does the reminding for you. You can add your important dates and the nokia will remind you when the date has arrived. So never miss a special day again.Clock: This allows you to change the time and date on your phone so you never go missing. This feature also has an alarm and a stopwatch which are very easy to set and use.Profiles: Getting sick of the look on your phone? If you want to change the background, ringtone, vibration and screen saver of your phone with different profiles this is possible.ADVANTAGES of 3310: The obvious advantages of the Nokia 3310 is the easy to use interface and its small which could almost fit in every pocket available. The vibration alert is also very handy if you are in a noisy place and cannot hear the phone ringing. DISADVANTAGES of 3310: The main disadvantages of a 3310 is that nothing has really changed from previous models of Nokia they are pretty much just cutting down on size. This phone shouls have been made as an internet ready phone but it wasnt.Battery and Charger: The extra small batery and the charger which plugs into the electricity panel is easy to use. Just Plug   Charge , its as easy is that.Hope the above tips help you make your mind up in deciding to buy a new phone     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5223101:4:::5202792:4:::5085331:4:::9435:4:::5203171:4:::5203171:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5208061:4:::5027357:4:::5212112:4:::5212112:4:::5091531:4:::5217827:4:::5217507:4:::5045878:4:::</endperson>

5201934::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::15.01.2002::::    I have only had this phone since May when my contract was renewed. Before this handset i had the Ericcsson T18, which now seems like a distant memory. This handset is lightweight, but a decent size, it is not too small or like a  brick . One function of this phone that i have found an added bonus is that the handset allows you to send a text with 459 characters, which is far greater than standard handsets, which means u can write a really long message but you only get charged for one text message. There is also a function that you can select on the handset that sends you message reports that lets you know when the message has been delivered to the mobile that you have sent it to. (So nobody can deny not receiving it when you have seen a report saying that the message has been delivered ) The keys are very user friendly, you do not have to press hard, but they are not over sensative. This phone also has the express on function facility and is marginally easier, in my opinion, to change than previous nokia express on phones. This handset also has a variety of games, which i find useful to keep myself occupied when i am on the train or waiting at a bus stop etc. Previous Nokia enthusiasts who enjoyed the games facility will be pleased to know that this phone has snake version 2, which is more advanced than the origonal, as well as another 3 games, one of which is space invaders that is also fun. This phone has so many added features that it is very impressive. One that is particularly useful is the reminder function, where you enter what you want to be reminded of, for example  exam , then it asks for the date, and the time that you want to be reminded. I find this very useful as i am quite frequently forgetting things  I could go on forever, but in general the Nokia 3310 is attractive to look at, a decent size, lightweight with several impressive functions that have certainly impressed me            ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5091531:3:::5013036:3:::5013036:3:::5202189:3:::5202189:3:::5101950:3:::5101950:3:::5096680:3:::5096680:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5096806:3:::5161824:3:::5090868:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::5001428:3:::5001428:3:::9879:3:::9879:3:::5078958:3:::5078958:3:::5096613:3:::5096613:3:::5066688:3:::5066688:3:::5055819:3:::5000696:3:::5091379:3:::5091379:3:::5012563:3:::5085430:3:::5017514:3:::20081:3:::5001930:3:::5001930:3:::23074:3:::1763:3:::5078938:3:::5078938:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5066721:3:::5202843:4:::5085666:4:::5085666:4:::23544:4:::5201921:4:::5201921:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5077810:4:::5096953:4:::5102019:4:::2256:4:::5096111:4:::5096111:4:::5003505:4:::5003505:4:::</endperson>

5196889::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::28.05.2002::::    Nokia 3310I have had my baby phone for about six months now and during that time he has changed his outfit on many occasions.  This is the best thing about a 3310 - you can change the covers and keypad as often as you like and as there are so many to choose from you can get one to match every outfit you wear (at the moment mine is blue with yellow smiley faces).  The price of covers or fashias range from about    6.99 to about    24.99 and the key pads are available with the covers or usually in sets of 3 for    9.99.  I tend to buy cheaper covers as I like to change them a lot and I am not made of money.  If I was I would have loads of expensive covers as they usually have the best colours/patterns/pictures on them.  The key pads also come in a variety of colours from plain ones to rainbow effect ones, from rubber to plastic.Nokia 3310s range in price from about    99.99 to    149.99.  I found that the price depended on the network and whether it is contract or pay as you go.  You can also get a phone for life which is about    199.99 which includes free texts calls etc.  It is light, small and simple to use.  Which is a good job, seeing as I got board half way through the instruction book and have never finished reading it.  It is small enough to fit in most pockets, but not to small to lose inside your bag.  A 3310 has 12 sections and you can chose one of the six styles for it.  The styles include silent, loud, general, discreet, my style (where you chose the preferences) and empty (where you can also design another.)  The twelve sections include:Phone book - stores up to 99 names and phone numbers, you can assign tones, send birthday cards, have speed dials, add voice tags and search for different help line numbers.Messages - usual things, inbox, outbox, picture messages, templates, smileys (smiley pictures)Chat - this is where you can have a text conversation with a certain person and messages are sent straight to that person without you having to search the address book.Call register - numbers and times for missed calls, received calls, dialled numbers, and call durationTones - 36 tones (most are rubbish) and space to save new ones, composer (to make your own tones),  screen saver and vibrating batterySettings - call settings, phone settings and security settingsCall divert - different ways to divert your callsGames - 4 games including snake 2, space impact, bantumi and pairs 2Calculator  - calculatorReminders - lets you set reminds and notes, you can also use the alarmClock - Alarm clock, stopwatch, countdown timer, and setting for date and timeProfiles - same as styles mentioned above.    The bad thing about a Nokia 3310 is that loads of people have the same one as they are very popular, however some people have a 3330 which is exactly the same except it has Internet connection.  Luckily for me. Most of my friends also use covers for their phones so they all look slightly different. In conclusion, I think that a Nokia 3310 is worth buying as it lasts ( mine has been dropped on many occasions and has survived), you don   t need to charge it every day like some phones and you can have covers and keypads to suit you.     ::::5311781:3:::5027279:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5186837:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::5217507:4:::19767:4:::5202052:4:::5202052:4:::5035657:4:::5202697:4:::9435:4:::5026778:4:::5026778:4:::5085331:4:::6389:4:::5217128:4:::5202678:4:::20105:4:::20105:4:::5020889:4:::5085430:4:::5041033:4:::5041033:4:::5091531:4:::5208310:4:::5096967:4:::</endperson>

5003661::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::22.06.2001::::    I can t remeber ever living without a mobile phone. My main purpose for getting a mobile mobile was that I needed to stay in touch with home, and occaisonally make calls to friends. I have gone through a number of different models, motorola alcatel and last but notleast nokia.I was quite happy with my nokia 5110 until the 3210 came out, the 3210 was quite expensive at the time, so I settled for a nokia 5110. I lived happily with it for a few moths, until I went away and gave it to a friend of mine. At the time I thougt I could get my brothers phone which was a 3210, my brother told me that he was going to stop the contrat that he had, and switch and to different contract, anyway to a long story short I thought that I could get the nokia 8210 free with a contract, but after having examined the phone closely, I decided not to get it becuase it was small and its buttons were small and its screen was small. I guess it was back to the drawing broad, until I saw an add in the paper, the Link was selling the nokia 3310 for    99. I went to the Link staight away and bought one.I like nokia 3310 because of its size, I thing I like about it is its large screen and buttons, I like that fact that I could could change its covers, its ringtone and icons, another thing that persuaded me to buy this phone and not the 8210 was that fact that it didn t have a large selection of covers on the market. I like that fact that it vibrates, which is very important to me because I tend to listen to my walkman when I am out somewhere, which means I don t ever miss a call. The thing I don t like about it is its predictive text, I can t seem to get a hang of it.This phone is really wonderful easy to use, and great value for money     ::::5080896:3:::5027357:3:::23074:3:::5022551:3:::5022551:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5085594:4:::5030751:4:::5040677:4:::5040677:4:::</endperson>

5021440::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::16.05.2001::::    This offering from Nokia is a robust, well designed phone packed to the rim with great features. I replaced my 3210 with the 3310 a couple of months ago and have no real complaints.My phone seems to be used mostly for playing the games which are none too challenging but provide great diversions when bored The 3310 has bigger memory than the 3210, can store more messages and numbers. Another great feature is the space for new ringtones which can be bought by ringing a premium rate line (if you re stupid) or by visiting an internet site such as iobox.com. This is a great way to personalise your phone.The menus are well laid out and easy to use, with the same basic system as the 3210 but with one or two extras thrown in. The only downside seems to be that EVERYONE seems to have one of these phones, so if you see your phone as a fashion accessory and want to stand out from the crowd, then maybe a Siemens or other make would be better.     ::::8234:2:::15460:2:::15460:2:::5014804:2:::6072:2:::6072:2:::5027359:2:::5000696:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5021406:3:::5021406:3:::5021353:3:::5021353:3:::15714:3:::5021441:4:::5021441:4:::22983:4:::</endperson>

It s cost is    99.99 but I think it s not that bad. Like most new Nokia models you can get cover changes for the phone and also you can get ringtones for it and it stores 7 and a graphic. You can again get them free on www.boltblue.co.uk Nokia are a good and popular company so you should have no problems with the phone itself, even if you do the customer hotline are helpful and informative. This is a popular phone at the moment and if your looking for a new phone and have cash this is one I would definitely recommend.     ::::2998:2:::7813:4:::7813:4:::</endperson>

5013174::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::30.06.2001::::    The 3310 is an amazing phone but one small thing can destroy all of its endearing features - heat. I received a 3310 this year as a birthday present. Having had the Nokia 5110 previously, I noticed a vast improvement with this particular phone. Some of the features that the 3310 has are impressive. However, it was a couple of weeks ago that the screen of my 3310 froze while I was writing a text message. Treating it as a one off case, I ignored the incident. However, it only became apparent to me that there was a serious problem with the phone when on a particularly hot day, my phone kept on freezing and truning itself off. This can be particularly frustrating when waiting for an important phonecall or message. I have come to realise that it is heat that causes these problems but whilst it is expected that problems will occur under INTENSE heat, I do not think that it is reasonable for these problems to occur just on hot days    However, although this does happen with the phone, it is not all bad, as it does have some great features. One is the fact that you can send picture messages and write longer text messages. My only criticism with this, is that by using all of the characters available, 30p gets removed from your credit, instead of just 10p. This even occurs if you are sending the message to another 3310. I only realised this when it became apparent that I had used all of my credit in half the normal time that I usually do. The tones are much more varied on the 3310 and has the advantage of being able to compose your own as well as to download ringtones. Furthermore, it has the option of vibrating alert. The games are also much improved - perfect for days of boredom    New games include improved snake, space invaders, a card game and another (but I have never played it before) With the 3310, voice tags can also be used to make it easier to call someone. To me though, this feature is just a novelty and a bit of fun, for most people would be too embarassed to use voice tags in front of other people    One feature which I was quite disappointed with, was the chat option. Previously, I overheard that this service allowed you to chat to other 3310 users on the same network, for FREE. DON T BELIEVE THIS - it is a complete con. All that this feature does, is organises your text messages in a logical order if you are having a conversation through text messages with another person. Pretty pointless if you ask me..... Other features that compensate for this though, is the  reminders  option which allows you to type in reminders such as people s birthdays, so that your telephone will remind you on the appropriate day. Furthermore, the  profiles  option allows you to easily modify your own settings. In conclusion, I would never change my 3310 -ok, so it freezes sometimes, but every phone has some flaws, don t they? The good features definitely outweigh the bad, although some might say that the cost of a 3310 is quite expensive. Although the newest nokia phone is much smaller, the 3310 has many more features, so I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new mobile - just make sure you keep it in a fridge....      ::::5046089:3:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5202751:4:::5202751:4:::6636:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::20081:4:::5035866:4:::22828:4:::22828:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5040957:4:::23074:4:::5020146:4:::10438:4:::5018728:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::</endperson>

22708::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::01.03.2001::::    I previously had the 5110 which, although bulky, (compared to other nokias), had a greater range of features at the time it came out than many of the other phones and I thought it to be the best phone.  I then got the 7110 which to me was so amazingly WOW that I had to get it (which I promptly did).  But then came the 3310.It came at the time I was due for an upgrade from my 7110 and in my opinion it couldn t have been at a better time.  Someone I know got the phone just before me and I was awed by the cute little thang.The huge range of features include chat, picture messages, ring tone composer amongst the usual nokia features, and the games, well, wow    The snake mazes (yes I am one of the unfortunate cases suffering from snake addiction) are amazing with diferent mazes and levels, and some of the newly featured games are really interestong too.This phone is not w@p enabled - that would make it one groovy work of art - but you cant have everything.  Stylish, modern, and a great phine to be seen with, the 3310 is a must-have for all.     ::::5000696:2:::22150:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::5002380:3:::5002171:3:::5001532:3:::5012426:3:::</endperson>

5003082::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::13.01.2001::::    I know alot of people are in love with the 3310 and I admit when I first saw it I fell in love with it too. It costs 105 pounds more than the 3210 on One2One and its not much better. I know its got all the new games and facillities but even all the teenagers will get bored of these games sooner or later. The shape of the 3310 is very similar to that of the 3210 but it is not as slim. Voice recordnition is also a wonderful feature of the 3310 but you can also get this feature 8210 which is alot smaller and lighter. I m sorry if you feel what I ve said is ofensive but I don t mean any harm. All I m trying to say is that If you want to buy a mobile phone don t just be attracted to the Nokia 3310 beacuse its got the most interesting features - just think about the practicallity of a phone. A mobile phone has a use and it is to contact people while your on the go not just to play fun games. If you want to play games you can buy a Play Station 2 the games are much better.        ::::23411:3:::5001532:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::23074:3:::9709:3:::5000806:4:::</endperson>

8958::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::10.01.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is a great little phone with loads of features.  Here are some of the things it can do.  Advanced messaging.  Have more fun with text messages on the Nokia 3310.  The cool new chat feature lets you talk using messages with your friends and family, while keeping track of the whole conversation.  On the other hand, if you have a little bit more to say, the Nokia 3310 makes it easy by automatically connecting up to three text messages - giving you plenty of space to get the message acrossMobile gaming is simply electrifying with the Nokia 3310.  The new vibra feature makes the phone vibrate at critical moments in gameplay - so you ll know when you ve been blasted by aliens in the cool Space Impact game, or when you hit the walls in Snake II  Of course, if your prefer more sedate action, you can always listen to the tones you have downloaded.  With all these features, what more could you need? How about voice dialing - just say the name and the Nokia 3310 will dial the number  Or maybe predictive text input to make messaging easier? Or picture messages to liven up your text messages?  What a great phone.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::10234:3:::10234:3:::5001532:3:::5299520:4:::13932:4:::</endperson>

5097026::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::09.01.2002::::    New Nokia 3310 differs by perfect management. Nokia one from first has developed a system of profiles - special complex tunings consisting of a type, loudness, character signals, availability vibrating ring and tones of the keyboard. In a new model each profile has received also own picture. One sight on the display - and at once is visible, whether the operational mode of the telephone for a street, office or theatre is optimized. The menu at the telephone simple and clear, for movement on it the button  Navi key  is intended, joining in itself of a key  up  and  down . With its help it is easy to hit in the buffer with telephone numbers and notepad. Highlight of Nokia 3310 is new function  chat , working on means of transfer SMS. For once it is possible to enter into the message up to 140 signs. When type it is possible to use the dictionary   1058;9 for the English, German or French languages. The dialogue happens in real time, and on a screen the whole dialogue is mapped; if the telephone at the interlocutor is not equipped with this function, the simple exchange SMS happens. Instead of chat simple exchange SMS also will act, if an operator does not maintain this function.Organizer in the telephone is not present, instead of it is whole section with reminder. They report to holder about the important event by beep and text on a screen. The telephone has many functions. There are in it four games, calculator, alarm clock, timer. But if to take out from the telephone the battery, all of set-up of date and time needs again to be setting. The voice set works confidently, but instead of traditional 10 marks at 3310 them only 8. For writing SMS it is possible to use one from eight templates and one from 14 pictures to apply to the messages. The absence of an external antenna does not make the phone less susceptible to signals of base station, loudness at the telephone good. During talks it can be adjusted with the help of largest button of the telephone, only it is necessary to separate a phone from ear, as side keys at Nokia 3310 is not present.ConnectionYes: large operating time in modes of talk and waiting, good loudness No:  noneConstructionYes: the large display, small size, removable covers No:  large weight, the illumination turns out only during gamesFunctionalityYes: function  chat , convenient system of fast tunings - profilesNo:  there is no own memory in the telephone, there is no automatic keyboard lock, it is impossible to connect to the computerManagementYes: convenient templates for writing SMS, intuitively clear managementNo:  noneIt is a great phone with many functions.     ::::5309724:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5101981:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::5092954:4:::5021353:4:::5021353:4:::5066721:4:::21963:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::5020702:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::</endperson>

713::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::21.01.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is impressive, yes, but in my opinion quite ugly. The games are difficult to understand but the graphics and the way the phone vibrates when the little snake hits the wall really gives the phone character that other phones don t have. If you leave vibrate on, the battery wears out extremely quickly. The phone itself is quite small and light and the cover can be changed, although they are expensive. It has a voice activated service but you feel really stupid when you re standing around speaking people s names into your phone. Also, it doesn t always recognise the names. Another good point abotu this phone is that you can program your own ring tones.     ::::5277861:2:::5277861:2:::7254:2:::7254:2:::7733:3:::5096643:4:::5092669:4:::1500:4:::1500:4:::</endperson>

5040928::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::04.10.2001::::    I have recently purchased a nokia 3310 on bt cellnet and after a month I feel I am ready to tell you my opinion of this classic fone The 3310 is the upgrade phone for the legendary nokia 3210  and what an upgrade it is. The 3310 is a phone that is only surpassed by the likes of the 8850.On this wonderful phone you have the likes of vibration alert( oo er missus) that allows you notice those annoying messags that you miss because you had your phone on silent. Also you have the likes of the ever useful composer which allows you to customise your nokia phone with new ringtones of your own devising or have them sent to you from certain companies that speacialise in ringtones and logos for nokia mobiles,however these companies often require you to call a premium rate phone number so are often quite expesive for example they can cost anything upto    2 a minute.The phone has no actual storage space itself so the number of names and phone numbers that can be stored depends on the sim card of the network and generally this is 100 names and numbers.Due to the technology used on this phone upto 10 people can be assigned unique ringtones that will only ever ring when the person they are assigned to phones you.It also has voice dialing that can be used to cut down the time that it takes for you to scroll through your phone book, however in my experience this is one part to the phone that is not worth using as it often fails to recognise your voice and so takes several attempts to get the required result.That is a short piece of info that hopefully helps you if you are looking for a new phone because maybe this is the phone for you.Thanks for reading     ::::5066721:3:::5046060:3:::17410:3:::17410:3:::5001428:3:::5001428:3:::9435:3:::9444:3:::9444:3:::5002380:3:::5093498:3:::5077810:3:::18021:3:::18021:3:::6644:4:::6644:4:::</endperson>

5026604::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::06.05.2001::::    The first thing that strikes you about the 3310 is it s size  It s so dinky, it fits neatly into the palm of your hand, as there is an internal arieal the phone appears even smaller. It s an extremly compact phone which fits easily into a small handbag or pocket. The phone has the same keys and access to the different parts of it s menu as all Nokia phones do. As a Nokia owner it didnt take me a bit to get used to, as with all Nokia phones it s very simplistic and user friendly. The phone has a wide variety of features, each of which are easy to again access to from the menu bar. The first function being to actually make a call  But with the 3310 you dont just have to look up the number in your 90 space address book you could always use the voice tag system, this way you only have to say to the phone Sharon, or who ever you have voice tagged and it will automatically ring that number  With voice tagging you record the tag and you must say exactly what you recorded or else the phone will not recognise the command so its no good shouting ring Shaz if you only recorded ring Sharon . This function can be used for 8 numbers if you should want. Now that I m a proud owner of a 3310 I ve also become a member of the irritating mobile phone ring club   There are plenty to choose from 20 in all.You can also download tunes from the net or even compose your own by pressing certain keys on the key pad  Should you not wish to disturb everyone with your catchy little ring tone you can also put it on to discreet, which arms the vibro alert  Text messaging, on the 3310 it has the predictive text so if you were to start a message with H it would automatically flash up HI for you. This does make text message composing a little bit quicker, but can be annoying when it decides you are going to say something u dont necessarily want to, this function can be turned off though so no problems there. Another function of the text messages is the ability to send the message to more than one user. So if you want to inform a number of people of the same thing you can send the message to all of them instead of having to send it one by one. There is also a picture messaging function and automatic smileys to personalise your text messages, but not all mobile phones have the capability to receive the pictures so be carefull as you could be charged for the text even though it was not received.Chat, ok I thought this was talking to someone on the phone but apparently not  The 3310 has the ability to send text messages similar to say using Yahoo s messenger. I have visions of school kids up and down the land chatting in real time via text messages in class  The 3310 has a reminder section which is very simple to use but make sure that you have actually set the clock and calendar first  Reminders can be set for any time in advance. You would obviously have to have the phone switched on to actually see the reminder icon flash up  This function can also be used with the alarm clock  This has tremendous potential for those of us who are a little forgetful when it comes to appointments etc...Extra s include 4 games ( I m getting a dab hand at space impact ), a clock and date function, a stop watch and a calculator. Accessories include the clip on Xpress covers, a hands free set, car recharging kit and a case for the phone  I did not actually buy the phone, but I have seen them advertised in The Link at    99.99 for a pay as you go phone, but you can get it free on contract(I had mine as a gift)So if any of you out there are looking to buy a mobile phone then I would deffinately recommend the Nokia 3310 for Men or Women, Boy or Girl.      ::::5309724:3:::21638:3:::21638:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5217827:4:::5026124:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5000696:4:::20081:4:::5017281:4:::5017281:4:::3653:4:::23544:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5000758:4:::5018904:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5018533:4:::5001880:4:::</endperson>

5076835::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::22.07.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is packed with lots of features, some very useful and others that will help you stand out from the crowd.The handset itself is very small and compact and has no visible ariel. The outside casing can be changed for a wide variety of cool designs to suit your mood, such as a budweiser can, a cadburys flake packet or cartoon design etc. The official Nokia cases can be quite expensive, as much as    25 but can be purchased cheaper from a market stall or discount store. Just make sure you have your mobile with you when you buy this way, so you get the right size. The handsets may be used with a variety of telecom providers such as Vodafone and Orange and each provides their own range of tariffs. The phones come with a number of ring tones and picture logos but additional ones of your choice can be ordered over the phone or downloaded from the internet for a small fee. My handset currently plays the Welsh National Anthem, sad I know, but I like it. Other features include calculator, games, smileys and call divert and also a personal planner that rings to remind you of important dates as they arrive. Voice tags allow the handset to recognise a name when spoken into the receiver which then automatically dials the number associated with that name, thus saving you dialing. Predictive text is another feature that upon typing a message will try to guess the word you are trying to type and will attempt to finish it off for you. This does tend to make mistakes but can be switched off. You can also assign different ring tones to different numbers in your phone book. This means that you know who is ringing without even looking at the phone. Call barring is also available if you have any undesired callers. When the phone is charged the power can last several days before needing a recharge.There are many other features that you may find useful that I have not mentioned here. The sets come boxed with a charger and a comprehensive instruction manual which includes a form to join the Nokia website.      ::::5309724:2:::5301118:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::14682:3:::14682:3:::5046089:3:::23074:4:::5000696:4:::5026862:4:::5026862:4:::16949:4:::16949:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::5066703:4:::5016911:4:::7026:4:::7026:4:::5076670:4:::6636:4:::5076640:4:::10201:4:::5055898:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::</endperson>

These games will keep you occupied for hours on end.  Snake 2 is skill in a sim and keeps me busy for ages. although bantumi is complicated i m sure that i will master it and it will turn out to be a great game like the others.  Predictive txt input for easy and quick typing, i love that   Group logos sao you know who is calling before you pick up the fone  Wowwee    screen savers  What will they think of nxt?

5341269::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::somewhat helpful::::19.05.2003::::    I have had this phone for just over a year now and have found that I can no longer be on the phone for more than a minute without it cutting out... even with a full battery  This is very inconvinient and is why I am being forced to purchase another.  It has also happened to a friend of mine, with the Nokia 3330, a similar design to the 3310. Overall it is a good basic phone and is simple to use, however not all that durable, so be warned.I think you would be better off looking to buy one of the newer range of mobiles that are frequently coming out, although they cost a little more, im sure they are worth it as will move with the age.     ::::5246451:2:::5246451:2:::5014851:2:::5014851:2:::</endperson>

5388673::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::12.10.2003::::    As my father is a tradesperson, I have been around mobile phones since the mid 80 s when they really were the size of a King James Bible (a Telecom (Aus) Walkabout, we used to call it  the brick ). I ve used virtually every brand there is and Nokia has been the most reliable of the lot.After a terrible experience with an Ericson T10, i decided to cave to popular opinion and get a Nokia. For the amount of money i was willing to spend monthly, the 3310 was the best and newest option availible to me.The phone comes standard with a navy blue cover, but i had a pink transparent nokia cover thrown in for free, which i still use. the cover, once you have the knack, is very easy to get on and off to change or access the battery and sim.The buttons are a silver thin plastic and are very easy to use - i do suggest that even if you change the cover to a non-nokia issue, use these silver keys. the chunky plastic ones that come with cheap covers are horrible  The spacing is comfortable for thumb-typing. The central menu key makes navigation simple.The screen is large by comparison to my old Ericson (with its dinky 2 line display ) and the yellow-green light is quite soft on the eyes in the middle of the night. Pre set  screen savers , small graphics of smiley faces etc come bundled on the phone.The shape of the actual phone is comfortable to hold and nice to look at. It is by no means the smallest phone on the market, and is too big for a girl to carry in her pocket, but its big enough that it doesnt get lost in the bottom of your bag.The phone is quite durable, but obviously care should be taken. My phone took a battering before finally showing some damage a couple of months ago when i dropped it quite hard on concrete (it bounced). I believe I have broken something inside as the phone will sometimes now turn itself off. I don t consider this a fault of Nokia though, since i dropped it :)The battery had a very good lifespan. Originally i found it was only necessisary to charge it every 3 - 4 days, depending on how often I made calls. With all things rechargable, the length between charges has shortened and i now need to charge it every day or 2. I do appreciate how long I can leave it on with minimal battery before it dies though.Reception is fine, and I belive this is a carrier issue not a phone issue anyway. Reception is definatly worse since moving to the UK and using Virgin/One2One.Overall, I have been very satisfied with the phone, and at the end of its useful life (March 2004 when my contract ends) I will be looking for another Nokia.     ::::5392677:3:::5392677:3:::5337786:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5076524:3:::5076524:3:::5015764:3:::5332141:3:::5246435:3:::5348259:3:::5348259:3:::5311794:3:::5311794:3:::5271642:3:::5379019:3:::5379019:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5403217:4:::5403217:4:::5371793:4:::5398265:4:::5367570:4:::5126903:4:::</endperson>

5370916::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::08.11.2003::::    First there was houses, then cars, then wives / husbands. Now the ultimate status symbol is something alot more portable, although potentially as expensive. A mobile.My original mobile I m ashamed to admit was the size, weight and shape of a breeze block. So I was delighted when I was offered a new and improved phone with my contract.The 3310 duely arrived (although in the week it took to be posted several new and improved models had already come out). This was roughly 2 years ago. I still have my 3310 and have to say I still love it. Although it is considered old and a bit of a relic now it is surprising the number of people of have this particular phone and the sumple reason they do it because it has all the features the average person would want from a phone, without having to pay a fortune for all the new bells and whistles.The 3310 has a range of standard features including the basic call ones, text (invaluable) and WAP which allows you to access certain internet sites for news etc. It has the capacity to hold quite a few ringtones so you can personalise your new best friend and it holds 20 messages which isn t a good number. For anyone who wants to dress up there phone it s easy to chance the case to something more to your liking, it also has several useful features such as good battery time and it takes the standard Nokia charger. Also each of the functions is easy to use and you re not constantly wondering what a particular flashing icon is.There are drawbacks to this phone which some people will be turned off by. Obviously it can t take and send picture messages, it s not as sleek to look at as some hand sets and it is a little big.However I don t really see this as a problem, there are few occasions when I d want to send a picture message (usually out drinking and in that case probably best not to see the photos). I don t mind it being big because you re less likely to lose it and although it isn t as nice looking as some it does survive being dropped and bashed around well which is very useful.I d recommend this phone more to parents and adults who want something practical rather than something designer. You can usually get it free when you start a contract and I ve never had any problems with mine.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5399756:3:::5281759:3:::5281759:3:::5351312:3:::5351312:3:::5337786:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5399644:3:::5399644:3:::5327057:3:::5326039:3:::5223538:3:::5370096:4:::5373083:4:::5373083:4:::5329676:4:::</endperson>

5092896::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::26.09.2001::::    I got the nokia 3310 because it  8217;s a highly popular phone and all my mates have it, the nokia 3310 is definitely worth the money because you get loads on it such as Phone book (which can contain up to one hundred telephone numbers) chat (chat to your mates) Calculator, (which is very good if you quickly need to do a sum, and cant be bothered to do it in your head, much like me then all you have to do is quickly whip it out of your pocket and start typing in the sum, easy. Reminders (if you  8217;re always forgetting things like doctors appointments) Clock (always know the time and date, and also set the alarm to wake you up in the morning) Profiles (personalise your phone here e.g. choose a ringing tone, ringing volume, choose the message alert tone turn vibrate alert on or off etc.Tones, (choose your ringing tone or make your own, you can also have ring tones sent to your phone from the internet and save them in the free spaces given)Games (which I think are really cool, you get snake two, space impact, bantumi, and pairs two)Messages (write your text messages here easily with the excellent predictive text input a real time saver if your writing a long message, you can write text Messages up to four hundred and fifty nine letters long and send them to people with no hassle at all, check your inbox for new messages and easily delete any old messages you don  8217;t want.)The nokia 3310 has easy to change express on covers and has voice dialling as well which saves you having to type in the number or scroll down to the right number in the phone book, all you have to do is say the name of that person and it will automatically start ringing them (providing you  8217;ve saved a voice tag on their name).This is a really nice phone for all; it  8217;s good-looking, easy to use a nice size and quite light too.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5092284:3:::21638:3:::21638:3:::5016738:3:::5016738:3:::5091695:3:::5085331:3:::5096215:4:::5095929:4:::5086154:4:::5093049:4:::</endperson>

5499901::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::14.05.2004::::    This phone is great, simply great. I wouldn   t have any other. Don   t go for any of these fancy picture phones colour screens etc just pick the 3310 Easy of useWell this phone is easy to use. The buttons are the right size to use and once you   re used to them you can use them without looking. The menu contains a variety of options including clock features, text messaging, phone directory and games. FeaturesText messaging     well this starts off with using predictive text which is basically where you don   t need to keep on pressing the keys to get to your letter. This may seem daunting at first but once you figure it out then you will be away  Or otherwise you can just change it back to normal textingPhone directory     This stores you   re names and numbers. You can also set numbers to certain keys and you can even record a voice tag to recognise them by. However this normally does not recognise your voice so I just use it for fun to playback my voice Chat     There is a menu where apparently you can chat to other people by entering their number. I have yet to use this feature even though I have had this phone for 2 years now. I don   t really see how it is any different from texting  But it must be somehow.Clock     Here you can set the time, date and alarm. You can also set a stopwatch.Reminders     Set reminders to alert you at certain times on certain dates.Tones     Select ringtones from a wide selection, change the volume, set vibrating alert.Composer     On here you can create your own tunes to set as ringtones and change their speed.Games     Ah here is where the all-important snake fits in  Snake is one of the games on here which involves you moving round a screen to gain points. It is highly addictive. Other games include space invaders, memory game and batumi (which I have only just discovered how to play )The phoneThe phone is about a 1/3 of the size of a CD case and is relatively light in weight. The battery lasts for me approx 2 days with it being switch off for a few hours. It only takes a few hours to charge up.One fault I have found is occasionaly like a few times a year when your are sending a message it freezees. You can either take the battery out or just leave it overnight to unfreeze. But that is only a minor fault.In all this is a brilliant little phone which cost me    129 two years ago. Nowadays you can pick one up for    69 about. It is well worth it if you do not require all the fancy features that phones nowadays provide.     ::::5500667:3:::5405168:3:::5473258:3:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5458626:3:::5085343:3:::5085343:3:::5414470:3:::5414470:3:::5393355:3:::5393355:3:::6854453:4:::6854453:4:::6413336:4:::6413336:4:::6860964:4:::6860964:4:::5415587:4:::5415587:4:::5485709:4:::5379383:4:::5410477:4:::5410477:4:::5013640:4:::5013640:4:::</endperson>

5275658::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::03.03.2003::::    This was my first ever mobile phone, and I have some really fond memories of it  I had this phone for over a year and it was very reliable. The design of the phone is really nice, modern and sophisticated. The changeable covers mean that you can change your look instantly, although the covers are quite expensive.The phone itself has great facilties. The vibrating alert is good if you don t want to have a ringtone but can be turned off as well. The reminder function is also very handy. You can also send and receive picture messages on this phone which is great fun, although picture messages do cost more than an ordinary text message.Be warned...the games on this phone are incredibly addictive, Snake II in particular      The price of this phone varies from package to package, but it is usually around    90 on pay as you go.The size and weight of this phone is also really good as it is small and light enough to fit in your pocket. The keys are also really easy to press, unlike some other mobile phones.The voice activitated dialling is also an impressive and useful feature of this phone.Overall I recommend this phone to anyone, from techno wizards to those who haven t got a clue how to switch on a mobile. This phone is really easy to use and has a wide range of impressive features.WELLDONE NOKIA       ::::5025486:2:::5025486:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5014851:3:::5014851:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5274315:3:::6389:3:::5331903:4:::5263896:4:::5299520:4:::5288452:4:::5151822:4:::5151822:4:::</endperson>

5217516::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::09.07.2002::::    I know what you re thinking, another review on the Nokia 3310 - well I thought I d get my opinion to you all.I am best suited to writing opinions on computer games - but I have run out, and I am now turning to the phones.The Nokia 3310 is undoubtedly one of (if not the) most common phone around at the moment. To those looking to buy a phone, I d be surprised if anyone did not recommend this phone.Now I don t know the innards of this phone - so don t expect me to give you exceptional details - instead I will give the features and what you can expect from this phone.EASE OF USE:This phone is incredibly easy to use. To those people who are not technology wizards, you will find this phone easy to use. The instructions in the manual are very clear, and it only requires an average of 3 buttons to get to any specific place on the phone. Previous Nokia users will also find this a doddle because the interface as always is the same.LOOK AND FEEL:The interchangable covers allow this phone to be moderated any way you like. These cost various amounts - normally about    5-   20. This phone brand is exceptionally common, so you cannot expect to be laughed at because your phone is bad. The covers can even have a photo you have sent into a certain company.The phone is a little chunky and heavy compared to newer phones but there is no problem with that - I personally want to be able to press the buttons properly without having to press three letters at a time (What I am getting at is the fact that the keypad buttons are nicely spread apart.DURABILITY:The phone is very robust. You can obviously get it insured in case, but apparently phones nowadays have to be able to withstand a 3m drop on concrete. The covers can slip off however, and if you do drop the phone, the covers can become loose.RECEPTION QUALITY:I am a previous owner of 2 other phones, and I have found this one to be the best - of course Nokia are probably the most sought after company in the mobile industry, so anyone can expect this quality in all their phones.GAMES:There are 4 games to chew over, Snake II, Pairs (I can t remember which version ), Bantumi, and Space Impact. Everyone knows Snake, and Pairs is like memory where you have to uncover the pairs which are the same from a collection of cards. Space Impact is a little like Space Invaders - where you have to shoot space thingies, and not be shot at or hit a rock. Bantumi is a complex game which is not well explained in the phone, and it takes time to figure out the rules to it.There are too many features for me to mention. It holds roughly 20 texts, 100 phone numbers (I think, for me it s 200, I think that s because I m a, sorry, on Virgin :-))The battery life isn t brilliant - the phone lasts surprisingly short, and if you are playing games, having sounds turned on, vibration on, and lights on, the battery life will run down. But remember to charge that baby for 18 hours first   Buy this phone if you can, it is a gem, and you will be happy with it. But with the newer models coming out, I wouldn t be surprised if this phone lasts in the shops much longer.     ::::5228278:3:::5066322:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5202792:4:::5202843:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5036152:4:::5036152:4:::5217475:4:::6088:4:::6088:4:::5223826:4:::5035866:4:::5202449:4:::5202449:4:::1704:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::5208310:4:::18116:4:::5027357:4:::5228343:4:::2998:4:::6389:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5186875:4:::5024797:4:::5024797:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::5078938:4:::5078938:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5001930:4:::5001930:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::</endperson>

5015901::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::07.04.2001::::    Take caution when buying your Nokia 3310, open the box immediately and test it. My Nokia phone s battery had worn out to such a state that I could use it only for a few minutes when it wasn t plugged into the charger. Not exactly mobile.  A terrifying motorway breakdown encouraged me to do something urgently. Requests to purchase replacement batteries were met with derision on the lines of   Oh, that   s ancient, how long have you had it?  Well, if four years is ancient, it was. And replacement batteries were not available. So it had to be a new phone.  You ll want WAP, texting, exchangable covers, etc etc etc .  Well, no  I said.  I just want a phone that I can make and receive calls on.  No way am I surfing the web on a mobile phone, or SNDNG TXT MSGS.And so the Nokia 3310 came into my life, arriving next day in a large jiffy envelope. I was impressed at just how small it was, smaller than the battery in my old phone. So compact. I swapped the SIM card, plugged in the charger and switched on. A moving picture of two fingers touching appeared. Novel. Entered my PIN number, got the signal strength and then looked at a blank screen. It had switched itself off. I could not get it to stay on while charging. So - six hours later - it was charged up and switched on. A thing of beauty. I fiddled around choosing a ringing tone. Why are they ALL so naff?? Put it to one side and got on with work. Hours went by without a call. I looked at it. It had turned itself off.And so it went on. It wouldn t stay on while charging. Often turned itself off. Sometimes the keys would lock up, then it d turn off. But it was intermittent. Sometimes it stayed on for a couple of days. But I got in the habit of checking it every few minutes.  Now - I thought I d been very clever because I ordered a spare battery at the same time. They sent the wrong one. The replacement was also wrong. So I spoke to my supplier several times. And I mentioned the phone that couldn t be used when charging and which kept switching itself off. And - to their vast credit - they said they d send me a replacement.And lo - the replacement can be used while charging, and hasn t switched itself off in the week I ve had it.So - for the Nokia 3310 it   s a 50  success rate. If your  phone acts like mine go back to your supplier. In fact, if it won t stay on when you initially charge it up, go to your supplier. There s a 14-day period when you can exchange it if you re not happy.Now I am happy with it. I like the silent mode when the phone vibrates to indicate an incoming call. I ve looked in the shops at those replacement covers, but they seem overpriced and not very interesting. How about black rubber with dimples, or leather with studs? (just an idea - I guess the vibrating phone has started thoughts deep in my subconscious).But I can t get over-enthusiastic. It   s a phone. That   s all. A phone.(If you want to learn about all the facilities of the phone, virtually ever other opinion on this site lists them in tedious detail, take a look. I d just say it doesn t matter about features if you can t receive or make a call.     ::::5022103:3:::5022103:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202843:4:::5035582:4:::5027473:4:::5618:4:::5019344:4:::3001:4:::3001:4:::23074:4:::1704:4:::2998:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::5020168:4:::6072:4:::6072:4:::16371:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::</endperson>

5522173::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::11.07.2005::::    When I first got this phone,  I hated it because everyone else had the same one and I wanted my old one back (I had had about 4 replacements of a different make of phone but decided to go for a  reliable one in the end). Nowadays, nobody has this phone, and since I ve changed the cover to a nice black and silver one it doesn t even look like a 3310, so I m damn proud of it  Overall this phone is excellent value for money if you just want to use it for texting and calling, and aren t bothered about games (although there are 4 on this phone they aren t great) and everything all the more recent phones have like video and picture messaging. It is a bit on the heavy side, and looks ugly unless you change the cover (in my opinion). A good first phone to have though.     ::::5670434:2:::5619976:2:::5619976:2:::5615600:2:::5314908:2:::5326499:2:::5326499:2:::5602332:2:::5341731:2:::5677261:2:::5645474:2:::5670103:2:::5344564:2:::5386276:2:::5386276:2:::5689055:3:::5665183:3:::5331868:3:::5331868:3:::5650117:3:::5650117:3:::5623795:3:::5080915:3:::5080915:3:::5641285:3:::5542379:3:::5303945:3:::5303945:3:::5601533:3:::5601533:3:::5487381:3:::5487381:3:::</endperson>

5404283::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::08.11.2003::::    This phone is by far better than the other 3 phones I have had before. It is about 13 centimetres long and 7 centimeter wide. My phone cost    139.99 and has stayed in excellent condition since. It is small enough to fit in Jeans pocket and your handbag. It is not bulky and fits snuggly in your hand when using it.The shape of it is rectangular and the screen is 4cm wide and 3cm long. The time can be set and is shown in the top-right coner of the screen. To turn off the phone ,push the rubber button at the very top of the phone case.The menu consists of:* PHONE BOOK - (search,add name,erase,edit,assign tone,send b card,options,speed dials,voice tags.)* MESSAGES - (write messages,inbox,outbox,picture messages,templates,smilies,message settings,service command editor.)* CHAT - (comes up with box to type phone number in.)* CALL REGISTER - (missed calls,recieved calls,dialled numbers,erase recent call lists,show call duration,prepaid credit.)* TONES - (ringing tone select,ringing volume,incoming call alert,composer,message alert tone,keypad tones,warning tones,vibrating alert,screen saver.)* SETTINGS - (call settings,phone settings,security settings,restore factory setting.)* GAMES - (snake 2,space impact,bantumi,pairs 2,settings.)* CALCULATOR - (calculate equations)* REMINDERS - (add new,view all,erase.)* CLOCK - (alarm clock,clock settings,date settings,stopwatch,countdown timer,auto update of time and date.)* PROFILES - (activate and de-activate ringing volumes and personalise.)The phone is very personalized and is very robust and will not break if you drop it.The reception quality is excellent considering you have  Orange  (so I dont know about other services).There are many phone covers to choose from and most of them are priced around    10.Battery is long lasting and is charged up in no time by the charger.games are fun , but there is not a huge selection There is a keypad that comes with each phone cover... but beware some of them can become a bit stiff.I hope you have found this information useful Happy Phoning       ::::5379019:3:::5379019:3:::5388766:3:::5066178:3:::5066178:3:::5186846:3:::5027357:3:::3728:3:::3728:3:::5349970:3:::5076524:3:::5076524:3:::5368168:3:::5246435:3:::5399644:3:::5399644:3:::5359510:3:::5403217:4:::5403217:4:::5379241:4:::5367570:4:::</endperson>

5040914::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::07.06.2001::::    For starters the Nokia 3310 is very well priced, great value for money. As opposed to those puny phones this one is a perfect size it is small enough to fit in any pocket but not small enough to be falling out all the time and getting lost easily (as those puny phones might).This phone has lots of features and what anyone might need.  It doesn t have the internet capability but it would surely take too long to read an e-mail on a phone screen anyway.  The phone can also be personalized in many ways and has the nifty feature of voice dialing  The Nokia 3310 also has the option of changing what it looks like completely.  Frankly this detail is no big deal.  At first one may think  oh well now i can make my phone look funky  but really once you ve bought all those  expensive  covers you won t b bothered changing the cover very often and thus you will have wasted money on the covers. If you like buy one really nice cover that you know you wouldn t mind keeping on the phone for good or just stick with the blue it comes with.  The phone might improve with an infrared port for compatibility with PDA s and the sort.  The phone also has the vibrate option which is great when at a meeting or concert situation, you can still know if you are being called or messaged without disturbing anyone else.  My experience is that the battery lasts for a very very long time. if left on standby the phone will remain on for days without recharging and when you do recharge the battery does so very quickly.  Obviously if the phone is used continuously thoughout the day the battery will get used up more quickly. If you are such a person who uses the mobile 24/7 you might want to invest in a spare battery. It might b expensive but if you have the money to be on a mobile 24/7 you can probably scrounge up some money for the extra battery.  This practical little package can also be set up for handsfree communication in a car (very convenient). I am sure there would be fewer traffic accidents due to mobiles if people would install these in-car phone devices.This phone is excellent. On one occasion I jumped into a pool forgetting that the phone was in my pocket. I kept on swimming for at least 15 minutes. then a friend who i was wrestling me asked me if i had remembered to take my phone out of my pocket. i hoped she was joking but indeed my phone was in my pocket and it was off. I thought i had lost it completely but NO  the practical little package survived. I let it dry and plugged it back in the the charger when i thought it was dry enough and low and behold the screen flickered on. The highlight of my day. I have also dropped it while trying to add money to the account and landed on it while aggressive skating numerous times and the case has some scratches from it but everything is in working order.  I have also noticed that reception on this phone is very good, perhaps thanks to my service provider but other friends with the same phone and different providers feel the exact same way.  In a quick sum up, this phone is practical, has all the most useful functions and i give it two thumbs up i would give it more but i lack the extra hands. oh and one more thing we can t forget that it has entertaining games on it, perfect for when you are waiting on someone.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5309724:3:::5026723:3:::5026723:3:::5202056:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::45:4:::44:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5026044:4:::3680:4:::3680:4:::5035582:4:::19851:4:::19851:4:::5019225:4:::5019225:4:::5022480:4:::5022480:4:::1903:4:::5018808:4:::5018808:4:::20081:4:::5019133:4:::9435:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5026251:4:::5026251:4:::5003492:4:::5003492:4:::20917:4:::20917:4:::5020054:4:::5020054:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::23074:4:::</endperson>

5890::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::05.06.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is great fun to use - with the newest Nokia games and the ability to customise logos and ringtones, you ll have a blast playing with this phone s great features. It s very easy to send logos and ringtones to the phone from websites, and they appear on the phone within seconds. I found the battery life fine, however when charging, the phone tends to display  battery full  long before it actually is. My only other criticism is that the phone s cover can become slightly loose. Other than these points, I d say that after owning a Motorola and a Nokia 5136, this phone is a cut above the rest. I recommend this phone, despite its hefty price tag - it ll be a while before this one becomes obsolete.     ::::5001205:2:::5001205:2:::5021406:2:::5021406:2:::3447:2:::6072:2:::6072:2:::5021440:3:::</endperson>

Apparantly the pay as you go phones are going up bye    30 but vodafone have already done this. I got mine at the nice price of    89.99 but be warned -  this was a bargain orange shop in my town - Derby.

5703194::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::20::::very helpful::::24.07.2007::::    Well, now we re going back in time. The nokia 3310. Its place in today s market makes it feel out dated, but there is bound to still be a few in use even as i write this. I was given one about 5 years ago (I had my first mobile phone 4 days after my 16th birthday, which wasn t a nokia at all). Yes, the features are extremely limited. This really makes the phone seem out of touch with the modern world. Yet for people who really only need to make phone calls or send text messages, there is nothing more that they need. Its so much more satisfying to have a mobile phone that can have lots of different functions on it, but lets be honest. What is the main function of a mobile phone?There are a few different things you can do on it (you can purchase ringtones although they do often sound dodgy on this old piece of junk, and you can even compose your own). However, you are limited to say, one note at a time. There are 4 different games you can play, with snake II being a popular favourite for users of this handset. bantumi is a more challenging one (especially as the levels do get considerably harder), although I have succeeded in winning on the hardest level.Functions. 1) Phone Book - adequate enough to store a name and a number. My Vodafone PAYT sim card can store 200 names and numbers on it. But the phone itself cannot.2) Messages - Depending on the length of each message received or stored in the outbox, depends on whether you can have 5, 10 or 15. Not a lot really for this day in age.3) Chat - This is more for ease when repeatedly texting one person. I ve never fully accessed this properly, but I will elaborate when I get the chance to4) Call Register - Keep tabs on who has called and who you have missed calls from. Nothing advanced here.5) Tones - Set up your phone to have a ringtone (there are a few stored on the phone already), and a message tone (although these are limited). You can compose your own as well. Which could either sound bad, very bad, or just plain awful, but in someways, they do reflect the songs.6) Settings - Set your phone up the way you want to (dealing with sending your own number if you wish to) - change the language from english if you fancy a change.7) Call Divert - basically does what it says. Diverting the calls. Different functions enable you to choose when it diverts, but thats about it.8) Games - There s only 4, and really, they are either too easy or too difficult. I mean, Snake 2 is only an advance on the Nokia 3210s Snake 1, where this one can go through the walls. Space Impact, a difficult game to master all the buttons to instantly, it really doesn t take too long to complete. Bantumi, for challenging the thinking, but that is really quite simple too, and also a version of pairs. 9) Calculator - what do you think you can do here? The very basics. Add, Multiply, Subtract, and Divide. Wow. Exhilerating. Really. (sarcasm should be spotted with that, don t you think?)10) Reminders - well, what do you want reminding of... lol.. store it here.11) Clock - You can choose whether or not to show or hide the time, and you can set the date. Wow, something really difficult to master (well, for some people, it could be, but im not looking to offend them deliberately)12) Profiles - Here is where you can set a profile up with a certain ring tone, ring volume, message tone, vibrating alert (basics really - considering how basic the phone is) - although there is only 1 space for you to create your own.13) There isn t one. Maybe the makers were superstitious. But it did throw me a bit to not see one.14) Vodafone - This one is where you could get information that you would probably find on vodafone live nowadays. Really, to get news and weather? To find out about the PAYT services available? Get a grip and go with it.At the end of the day, I have to stick with this phone at the moment as I have no money left to buy a new one, but all i need is to be able to receive phone calls and texts, all the MMS and Video sharing I m not saying I don t like, its just this phone will not let me do. My experience shows that for every  extensive  phone i ve had, the Nokia 3310 has been there for me if there was some problem with my other phone. That and Vodafone have been the best PAYT that I have used. And I have used more than just one or 2 networks...     ::::5241315:4:::5241315:4:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5843359:4:::6454624:4:::6454624:4:::6377088:4:::6377088:4:::5530202:4:::5530202:4:::5769137:4:::5769137:4:::6445787:4:::6445787:4:::6417607:4:::6417607:4:::5301762:4:::5301762:4:::5647565:4:::5647565:4:::5926894:4:::5926894:4:::6463906:4:::6498222:4:::</endperson>

5022781::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::07.04.2001::::    The 3310 was my first mobile and i have had it for 4 incredible months, it brings me nothing but pleasure with its vibrating function, which is far more smooth and sexy than the other nokia models. There are loads of games to occupy the child within and an excellent key pad which makes a high score a certainty. I find the covers a little over-priced but they are optional and looks gorgeous whatever. A must for the discerning mobile user, and especially for snake fans.

There is not much else to say about the phone im sure you know some one with one as they are so popular so i would have to say take a look you WILL be please.Everyone please write a comment, do you think there should be a message tone composer and do you face the problem stated above all the time?Happy Phoning - Dave     ::::6072:2:::6072:2:::5027300:2:::5027300:2:::5027242:2:::5066850:3:::5026862:3:::5026862:3:::5012426:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::23074:3:::16615:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::2998:3:::5026963:3:::5065833:4:::6668:4:::5035646:4:::5035700:4:::</endperson>

2875::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::19.01.2001::::    Last month, shortly after Nokia 3310 cellular phone came into the Chinese market, I bought a blue one for my wife. In simple, I bought it as a gift for my wife, but the real reason is that this new model has a lot of merits such as functions and performances.I don t want to depict the detailed functions and features of Nokia 3310 cellular phone, because the advertising information is better than me, they will show you all about this. But I just want to say something in my own opinion. As far as I know, Nokia 3310 is the perfect combination of its 8210 and 3210 models. That s is to say 3310 has the outlook of 8210 although it is larger than 8210, and it has all the functions of 8210, what s more, this new model has the Chinese input method in the address box, that s very important to the Chinese consumers. At the same time, it s lighter than Nokia 3210. At last, I want to notice you that it is much cheaper than Nokia 8210.I love the human-friend operation menu and interface. It has only three functional buttons, but you can do what you want to do with just one finger, that s great  I don t think there is any shortcoming of this new product.I think most of the young women and teenagers should buy this new mobile phone for communication.     ::::5020426:3:::5020426:3:::17253:3:::17253:3:::23158:3:::15442:3:::23074:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::5000051:3:::5000051:3:::5001532:3:::</endperson>

5036030::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::31.05.2001::::    I bought this after christmas with my christmas wage packet, it was difficult to get hold of - such was the demand and i had to wait until mid February, but when it arrived i was impressed by the functions it has even over such phones as the 3210. There is a marked improvement. Especially over my old phone, a Nokia 5110 that was beginning to show its age.The vibrate alert means you can always tell when there is a call without having to hear the phone ringing, often its not possible or considerate to have it playing some stupid tune. The chat function interested me, and as i haven t used this yet i cannot comment on it. But it looks fun. Same as messages just ongoing and quicker i would assume. I found the reminders very useful, the programmable notes with alarm provide no excuse for missing things anymore. With plenty of characters available you can input a detailed account of the upcoming event. That leads on nicely to the improved messages service, with this phone you can type up to 459 characters as opposed to the previous 160 - a big difference. Also available is a dictionary in five European languages - English, German, French, Dutch and Turkish (on my version of the phone - other networks might offer more or less). You can input smiley faces into the message too, and has space for adding your own ideas. The picture messages are also improved from the 3210, with much more space and variety of image. Also incorporated is the ability to receive extra picture messages from others. The ringtones section has been advanced aswell, there are now 7 free spaces to input your own tone. At the moment i have cartoon theme tunes. hehe, well i am still young Also, the games have been improved. Space impact - quality and simple and Bantumi - which i don t understand, have been added and that tedious game of Logic has been removed. Also Rotation is not on this phone, which, for me, is a blessing. Snake 2 offers a new challenge and is much harder, but it is much better than the original. Good to play on the train  Finally the Profiles section adds the scope to add more personalisation to the phone, you can change the names for the settings, like Silent/Loud etc. I found this phone is very good and does offer a lot more for the individual to make of it. The personal settings, ringtones, logos and pictures all add the personal touch. So far i have found no faults and am very impressed by the phone       ::::22154:3:::22154:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5348863:4:::5348863:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::5017281:4:::5017281:4:::</endperson>

5035969::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::28.05.2001::::    Being a previous owner of a Nokia Phone (5110) and being satisfied by that, I decided to stick with Nokia for my next mobile phone, the 3310. The 3310 is similar to the 3210, but, is a bit smaller and a bit more attractive with a few more extras. It has changeable front   back covers, which cost    10-20 . . . and of course there are so many colors to choose from you are bound to find one that suits your preference. The screen display is larger than some of the other Nokias around, including the 8210. Sound quality is good, I found it to be better than the 5110. It has the same menu navigation as all the other Nokias, which is simple to use. And the keys look smart and small. There is Voice Tags, where you can attach a voice tag to each name in your address book, and then with a simple press of a key all you need to do to call your buddies is say their name and your 3310 does the rest  There is predictive messaging input, which allows for faster writing of text messages. And a new chat feature  Which allows you to chat to your friends in a messenger format, like you would on the Internet in a chat room or using a Instant messaging program. This is all done from the phone. There are four games (Snake II, Pairs II, Space Impact, and Bantumi) Each looks better than the games that were on the previous Nokias thanks to the larger screen and smoother animation. There is a calculator and a reminders feature allowing you to make your phone remind you of those little things you never remember to do  Overall, this is a highly customizable phone, with screensavers, space for extra ring-tones, a composer to create ring tones and pictures for picture messaging. A great small phone, one which I recommend without hesitation.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5040824:4:::6636:4:::</endperson>

5012537::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::20::::helpful::::02.03.2001::::    Just a few words of advice, if you already have a Nokia 3210 then dont waste your precious cash on a slightly shorter fatter phone than the 3210.  About the only extra quality it has other than looks compared to the 3210 is the fact that it has more picture messages.  Well woopy doo I am so happy about picture messages especially considering barely any phones pick up picture messages anyway.The popularity of the 3210 is what has made the 3310 successful.  People know its the same yet they are still stupid enough to buy it.  I really dont have many good points to give about the 3310 that are new.  Other than the fact that not as many people have that phone.  But that will change and soon everyone will have one and so you will have the same phone as every other person.Do yourself a favour and dont buy this phone, unless it is your first mobile phone you buy because there is no point in replacing a mobile phone with another almost exactly the same.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5017708:3:::5002015:3:::5018961:3:::5208455:4:::</endperson>

5018029::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::20.06.2001::::    I guess most of us can t really imagine life without mobile phones anymore, I know I use mine an awful lot. I work as a contractor so I don t have a fixed work number and the mobile is the easiest way for people to track me down. I ve had a mobile since about 1993 when I was one of the first customers of the new mobile provider Orange. When I signed up there were only two Orange handsets to choose from, a really horrid Nokia and the Motorola MR1. I chose the Motorola, mainly because it looked nicer and it had a  flip  to cover the keypad and stop you inadvertently dialling everyone whilst the phone was rattling round in your handbag. The phone was fine, it dialled, it rang, it stored numbers. Ok it was the size and weight of a housebrick but back then it was cutting edge technology - I was the envy of my friends.Several years later I realised that I was now the laughing stock of my friends and decided to upgrade - which I did to the Nokia 5210 - again mainly on looks (it had a cute sliding panel to cover the keypad) but also because my then boyfriend had the same phone and it meant I could use his hands free car kit.Then last month I decided the time had come to upgrade again, the power button on my 5210 had fallen off which meant you had to use a biro to turn it on and off and it was looking a little tatty round the edges. A visit to my local phone shop revealed that the cheapest upgrade I could get was the 3310, I persuaded my fiance that he should switch to Orange so we can call each other cheaply and he went for the 3310 as well (it s free for new contracts )The phone s great, it s small, it has loads of room for storing numbers, voice recognition, games, pictures to include in text messages. There are a few small bug bears for me though - Firstly, I have to remember to lock the keypad or I end up annoying my friend Alison who s number appears first in my phone book. Secondly, when you write a text message and send it the phone goes back to the edit message screen and you have to back your way out of the menus. And finally, mine has a bright purple cover because I had to distinguish it from my fiance s and it was the only cover they had in the shop (other than one with Budweiser or Playboy logos )All in all I m happy with my little Nokia friend - but does anyone know if you can turn the earpiece volume down as mine s incredibly loud      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5013071:3:::6636:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5026754:3:::5026754:3:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::3447:3:::5003280:4:::5050930:4:::5040868:4:::</endperson>

5001177::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::04.02.2001::::    I recently got this phone after upgrading from my Nokia 7110, the first thing I noticed was the weight difference, the 3310 is extremely light and also fits in the hand quite nicely too.You can also personalise this phone with the changeable front and back covers (as like the 3210.)The phone itself comes with a vast amount of features and games, of course you have Snake II in there as with all the new Nokias at the moment - but the other game included are Space attack - Pairs and Buntumi (not figure that game out yet. Also included is a chat feature for sending mutliple txt msgs.The battery life on this phone is extremely good and lasts for around 4 days on standby and 3.5 hrs talktime it also charges fairly fast and normally you have a full charge in 60 minutes. Another nice little feature is that it comes supplied with a hands free kit therefore if you make calls whilst on the move and you normally have to buy a hands free kit saves you around    15     ::::5001519:2:::5001519:2:::5020889:3:::5003270:3:::4665:3:::5012948:3:::5012948:3:::5002171:3:::</endperson>

5002066::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::11.02.2001::::    Having seen one for the first time, I was very impressed it  8217;s very light and pretty good looking. The talk time is excellent and the battery stand by time isn  8217;t bad either. You certainly won  8217;t be left stranded with this mobile. The Nokia 3310 has built in chat messaging service,  and with the choice of changing covers, it can be more interesting to say the least. It has a built in smiley system which can certainly brighten up your messages, and let  8217;s face it we do sent a lot of text messages.You can send longer messages than ever before, by connecting three messages into one. The reliability is excellent and they always arrive instantly. You can install your own screen savers, and caller group profiles. My friend has added tunes for different members of her family, so even though she doesn  8217;t know who  8217;s called, she can instantly recognise it by the tune. Sites like boltblue.com are compatible and are very good to add logo  8217;s and free tones. The voice dialling is excellent, and you can voice dial up to eight numbers, and trust me it  8217;s very impressive and definitely distinguishes this mobile from others. With the excellent graphics display, you can send pictures, which are already installed in the Nokia. Of course it  8217;s got the games which you can now play with the vibra feature, which certainly doesn  8217;t make it seem your playing on a mobile. 4 games to chose from snakes, pairs, space impact and bantumiOverall an excellent mobile, good looks and loads of things to keep to busy with. I love the voice dial and the fact that you can change your mobile covers, back and front to suit yourself.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5015645:3:::11829:3:::11829:3:::5012276:3:::2698:4:::5001880:4:::5003538:4:::5015606:4:::5012426:4:::5002069:4:::</endperson>

5002213::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::14.01.2001::::    I have always been really impressed with Nokia, and had a 3210, but when that contract ran out, I decided to get a new one, but this time my free phone was a 3310. The 3310 is very similar in features to the 3210, minus voice activated dialing, and snake 2..... but it s a lot more chique, and Very sexyWith the 3310 you can download 6 new ringtones - where as the 3210 was only one, you can even compose your own by pressing certain keys on the keypad  Should you not wish to disturb everyone with your catchy little ring tone you can also put it on to discreet, which arms the vibro alert  Text messaging, on the 3310 it has the predictive text like the 3210 so that makes text message composing a little bit quicker. Another function of the text messages is the ability to send the message to more than one user. So if you want to inform a number of people of the same thing you can send the message to all of them instead of having to send it one by one. There is also a picture messaging function and automatic smileys to personalise your text messages Extras include 3 games, a clock and date function, a stopwatch and a calculator. Accessories include the clip on Xpress covers, a hands free set, car recharging kit and a case for the phone       ::::17253:3:::17253:3:::19851:3:::19851:3:::</endperson>

5002383::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::04.03.2001::::    The 3310 is one of the hottest phones around.  Basically, it is aimed at teenagers and it has a lot of nice features.  The phone has voice dialling.  This is basically when instead of typing the number out on the phone s keypad, you just press a key, say the name and the phone will do the rest.  The Nokia 3310 can also vibrate, meaning no more confiscated phones at school.At 133g and with no protruding antenna, it is easily pocketable - its dimensions are 113x48x22mm.  However, it is not too small, like the Nokia 8210, which looks like a freebie from a pack of cornflakes.  The keys are just the right size and they are very responsive.  One bugbear is the Xpress on covers, which go on the front and back of the phone.  They are just too flimsy, and start creaking badly after a few months, meaning that you will often have to save up for new covers. There are 35 ringtones pre-programmed into the phone.  These range from jazz to classical to even christmas and new year tones.  If you get bored of them, there are seven blank spaces where you can compose your own tunes or get them from the internet.  You can also download operator logos and picture messages.I suppose the main reason for people wanting this phone is because there are 4 games.  If you haven t heard of them already, they are:Snake 2 - similar to the old snake 1 except you get a choice of six mazes.  It is also easier to play because of the good keypad.Space Impact - It is just like space invaders, where you shoot aliens and rockets and face bosses at the end of the level.  Fun to play.Bantumi - Claimed by Nokia to be an ancient African strategy game.  I don t really understand it but there are detailed instructions atwww.nokia.com/games .Pairs 2 - an updated version of memory with better graphics and two modes of play which are puzzle and time trial.Oh, and just to say that the graphics you see if you get a high score are outstanding.Other features on the 3310 include the infamous chat, predictive text messaging, a calculator, a clock, a reminders section and the ability to make your own profiles.I understand that the phone is generally free on contract and    70-   100 on prepay.So don t get the 3210, get the 3310.  Believe me, you will love it.I wonder what the next in the Nokia series will be.  The 5210?  The 3410?You ll have to watch this space      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5019188:3:::5019188:3:::5018463:3:::5021412:4:::9879:4:::9879:4:::6389:4:::5018983:4:::5003492:4:::5003492:4:::20081:4:::5016866:4:::2998:4:::5001519:4:::5001519:4:::</endperson>

8206::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::30.10.2001::::    I bought a 3310 a few months ago and I am happy enough with it. While it was not what I set out to buy; the price and availability were right. Everywhere you go, 3310 s are there, but this is an advantage rather than a problem, since it means that servicing and accesories are far easier to come by. It is about the right size - not too small that you wouldn t notice if it was gone....but at the same time not taking up all the room in your pocket. The features are, I guess, about the same as most other phones of the year, plenty of little fads, the games etc, and the ringtones and logos can be found everywhere you look.My major gripe would be the original facia it came with...a lovely baby blue colour. Quite frankly it looks aweful, and it wasn t very long at all before I bought a replacement. Maybe it is good marketing by Nokia to sell the extras, but a plain black phone would be better in my opinion.But at the price, you won t go far wrong...     ::::6588863:1:::5279552:2:::6072:2:::6072:2:::5091531:2:::5085331:2:::5022551:2:::5022551:2:::17410:2:::17410:2:::5025810:2:::5512408:3:::5003505:3:::5003505:3:::</endperson>

5015313::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::22.02.2001::::    The look and feel of the phone are lovely and the user interface is V E R Y easy to use but there are a few  niggly  things up with it, like not vibrating every time the snake eats a dot but does sometimes and the voice activation doesn t work properly ( although I have never seen a voice activator that successfully works yet ), I mean I could just imagine my step sister walking through the middle of Bradford shouting  My house  into the receiver and getting no result, it s be SO FUNNY but thats straying from the point, the phone has a nice feel to it but has a few glitches which need ironing out. A nice phone but when thes oftware updates come out DEFINATELY get them to see if they iron out the creases. Definately worth it.     ::::6588863:1:::5001205:2:::5001205:2:::5001498:2:::</endperson>

5018145::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::24.02.2001::::    The Nokia 3310, I love you and want to marry you.  You are small, perfectly formed, and you have every feature I require.  The 3310 offers a large amount of options and add-ons, which can be very useful.  I did own a 5110 (the one everyone had), but I upgraded.  Don t like the colour, buy a new cover, and have anything.  Nokia s own, retailing @ about    20, or another company for about    10.  On this phone, u can snd and recieve txts 24/7, which iz gr8.  Also, the reception is perfect in most areas.  In London, I get four bars almost everywhere.     I know what you are thinking, it s just a smaller 3210. No, it is not.  With new features like vibrating alert for calls and texts, voice recognition for calling, and brand new games, you will never be bored.     Daniel you say, what about the ringtones?  Well, if you do not like them, change them.  This ability has been around for ages, whereby you phone up a company, tell them what you want, and it is sent to your phone in a text message.  Like downloading, but onto your phone.  This service is available free on lycos.co.uk   Daniel, I hear you cry, what about a picture on my phone?  Well, just like a ringtone they are available on websites for free on if you phone a company for them.  They will generally charge about    3 for each one.   But, this phone is so small, you might just lose it down the back of your sofa.     ::::5309724:2:::5018050:3:::5018050:3:::5017786:3:::3715:3:::5016425:3:::5016560:3:::21826:4:::21016:4:::</endperson>

5002080::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::22.12.2000::::    I wrote this op a good while ago, when the Nokia 3310 was a real novelty, and few people owned one. Now, of course, no pub table is without at least one. Sadly, mobiles in pubs seem to be a good barometer of what s going on in the mobile market... Hence, I m giving the whole thing a complete re-write.Now, the Nokia 3310 is a big phone. Big, that is, next to Sony s latest offerings, or the more expensive 8210. Of course, at under 5 ounces, it isn t like lugging a brick round in your pockets... my previous mobile was a 5110, which *was* like a house brick in your pocket. And it had less features.Features? The 3310 is full of them. It has vibrating alerts, screensavers (I ve yet to understand why, but there ya go... people do seem to like them) a range of ring tones, and a large memory for your own tones, be they composed or downloaded. It also offers the ubiquitous interchangeable covers, and these are startign to become widely available for the 3310 in recent months.T9 text input is now commonplace, and of course the 3310 allows you to use it in a number of languages (what do you mean you don t text anyone in French? I use that one all the time...). Chat style messaging is rarer, and useful if you have long  conversations  by text, as it helps with keeping track of what has been said. There is also a facility for sending longer messages, up to 459 characters, by sending up to 3 messages which can be concatenated again on delivery. Of course, Nokia s usual features such as operator logos, picture messaging, adjustable and preset profiles (such as  discreet  and  General )are intact, and should you still have the charger from your old Nokia it should still work with the 3310 - as should an in-car charger. Full car kits, of course, are not interchangeable, nor are batteries, but that isn t entirely surprising.And Nokia give Manufacturer s guarantees on everything, so robustness is a certainty.The Nokia 3310 is currently one of the best mobiles available on a pay-as-you-talk basis. For an 8210, or a nice little Sony CMD-Z5, you are going to have to fork out a regular monthly payment, have a good credit rating and use your phone an awful lot to get any kind of value from it. If for any reason you have to get a pre pay mobile, this is as about good as they get.The price of prepay mobiles has recently shot up, but with a little hunting around you should be able to spend less than    100 on a Nokia 3310.My one quibble is the lack of a WAP facility - this has been rectified with the release of the 3330, but at present this is a contract only mobile. It is apparently identical to the 3310, but it has an extra menu option, allowing you to use the Wireless Applications Protocol. I wouldn t bother, personally - when the 3G mobiles come out, WAP or it s descendents will be worth having, and not before. Of course, that s just my (slightly controversial) tuppen orth. Lacking an IR port is a slight problem, but I can t say I d use it much myself...Quick list of features:EFR (so good reception)Changeable covers (if you like that kind of thing)Decent battery life (a couple of days with normal use)Available on prepaySmall enough to slip in your pocket/bagAll usual Nokia personalisations (ring tones, icons etc.)Vibrating alerts, for busy situations and/or libraries etc.No WAP, no IR communicationsand so on for evermore... ;-)     ::::5001374:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5092095:4:::5066721:4:::5077810:4:::5085480:4:::5085480:4:::5080088:4:::5003538:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::5001293:4:::</endperson>

5003625::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::19.01.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is a pretty phone, but like the other Nokia phones, it s far too popular and nearly everyone has one. But the Nokia 3310 is very customisable so although everyone may have the same phone, you can make it so its different. There are also many features with this new phone, you can have a chat system going between another Nokia 3310, similar to ICQ or MSN messenger, there is vibration, not only for when it s in silent, but also when playing games. The new feature that this phone has is a screensaver, allowing you to have funny pictures on the screen while it s not in use. Plus the standard features you can gt on phones nowadays like text messaging and reminder.The Nokia 3310 is packed with lots of features and yet it is able to stay as a tiny phone which fits neatly into your palm. This is the best phone anyone can get, and so i highly recommend anyone to buy one.     ::::18033:3:::18033:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::5000051:3:::5000051:3:::2698:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::10438:4:::</endperson>

5002411::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::02.01.2001::::    Currently this mobile is undoubtedly the best of the Nokia range of mobiles and has some of the best technology in the world of phones. It has unique features and includes the amazingly addictable game of Snake 2. You can buy extra covers for your 3310 but many shops have sold out of these X-press covers very quickly. Each cover cost around    9.99 to around    13.99 and you can buy them from any good mobile store (unless they   ve sold out, of course). You have seven ring tone spaces available on the phone which you can fill up with cool tones like the Mission Impossible theme and Destiny   s Childs Say My Name On the net you can get ring tones for the phone and I currently only know of two sites called boltblue.co.uk and iobox.com. You have the large space of 500 characters for text messaging which is a great difference from the standard 150 characters. Logos are available on the web for your start up screen, which you can also get from boltblue.co.uk. Some sites have logos available for their own product, such as Bud.co.uk has Whassup ? and the official Budweiser logo available. With all phones there is at least a minor detail and in this phone minor is an overstatement. The fact that the new WAP technology is not available may slightly put you off but over than that this phone should certainly be at the top of your birthday list.

5014665::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::07.04.2001::::    Buying a mobile phone, for most of the people it  8217;s a serious need, for their way of life. But beyond the obvious use of a cell phone, for a great amount of people, cell phone is also for fun. You know, you can send SMS messages, send logos and picture messages, ringtones, etc. If you think it over, the Internet has the same common features, like we use it for doing our work, but we use Internet for fun also, like chat at IRC, send e-cards, e-mail  8217;s, play games etc. If you are this kind of people, you   8216;II love Nokia 3310. Why? Because Nokia 33100 has a new advanced messaging system which allows you to have text message conversations with other phone users, just like you do in IRC  Moreover 3310, has a set of smiley templates which you can put in your messages (you know like IRC stuff [ :-) :-( ;-) ] ). All of you IRC friends you   8216;ll feel like home  In addition, you can to make have a log and keep tracking the whole conversation. If you need to send long messages, Nokia 3310 can autoconnect up to 3 messages so you don  8217;t have to do it manually. You   8216;re game lovers? Well, if you   8216;re 3310 will impress you with the new vibration (called Vibra) feature during the games, just like you had a vibrating gamepad (left, right, left,   8230; vvvvvvvvrrr I crashed my snake   , gameover    ) . However, there is some new games also like Space Impact, Pairs II and Bantumi, be sure you   8216;ll spend some ours to play with your new phone   For more fun Nokia, stuffed this phone, with some cool screen savers (screensaver in a mobile ???) . Well, this is quite funny and trendy, which certainly will impress you friends. Like Nokia 3210, the new model has the ability to change covers to make it really trendy, or just change the look by your daily mood. If you need some more, Nokia 3310 has picture messages, operator logos and caller group profiles, up to 10 event reminders, send mass message to multiple recipients, create message templates, create message smileys, and many more. You don  8217;t need to pay to much for the new Nokia 3310, it  8217;s almost free    I have 3 Nokia phones for me (7110, 8890, 6210) but I bought this one just for a present for my girlfriend  8217;s sister. For  100 it was a very good present and I we   8216;re all happy now.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5019046:4:::5019046:4:::5001205:4:::5001205:4:::23745:4:::23745:4:::4881:4:::</endperson>

5014781::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::12.02.2001::::          I recently upgraded to a Nokia 3310 from a Nokia 5110, and the improvement is significant for little extra cost. The 3310 looks stylish- it s that tiny little bit smaller than it s nearest relative, the 3210, and is streamlined and thin. I don t think that it is too heavy as a phone, but I certainly drop often enough. Slippy  It s big pros are:its ability to receive pictures, logos and ring-tones,the updated games- a new version of Snake and a Space Invader game as well as a couple of othersthe  profiles  option, which allows you to keep settings on your phone stored, to be activated at the touch of a buttonit vibrates. Mmmm The 3310 is popular now. It s good value for money- most Nokia phones are, and it s definitely in the affordable price range. But my advice would be to get it now, because next year there ll be a slinkier, cooler little phone that everyone will want too.     ::::5020889:2:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::18021:3:::18021:3:::5002819:3:::5002819:3:::5012426:3:::18451:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::22828:3:::22828:3:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5371:3:::5371:3:::</endperson>

5001483::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::17.02.2001::::    When i saw this mobile advertised i was extremly impressed by it. Nokia have always brought out good, and rather neat phones, with a wode range of functions. I played on my friends 3310 I decided to get rid of my old phone, and go and purchase my own 3310. I looked at it for 1 second and thought, it was a great phone, and it is.The nokia 3310 is small and light. Compared to its predesesor the 3210 it is much smaller, and it fits neatly into your hand or into  your pocket or your bag. The phone has a nice set of keys, and it has the same layout as all the Nokia phones do. As it was my first Nokia I found it remarkable easy to get around the phone, unlike my old phone.There are some excellent new features on the phone, one especially is great. The voice Tag. The voice tagging system allows yoy it record up to 8 names. You must say the what you recorded otherwise the phone will not rcognicse the command. it is a great and easy way, instead of scrolling throught the address book, just to fing someone.The 3310 comes with a rather good composer, and it allows you to download 6 new ringtones. If you do not wish to make a noise there is a rather cool ring tone that allows it to go discreet, which means the vibrating alert.Sending a Text on the phone could not be simpler. It has a predictive text, this makes writing a text quicker, if your on the run. Plus the phone allows you to send one text message to more than one mobile phone, so no more of this having to send the same text one by one. The picture texting tops it of for me. You can send little pictures or smileys to your friends on their birthday, or even a Heart for Valentines day.There is a small chat function on the phone. This allows you to chat by sending text messages to another user, like MSN, yahoo, ICQ messengers. It is a rather ingenious idea and one which is for the futre i would believe, as it is rather limited at the moment.A few other functions make the phone great. The reminder function is a extremly simple function, but you must have set the clock and the date first brfore you can get reminder. This can be used as far in advanced as liked, but the phone must be on for you to see the reminder. Other features included the 4 games. Snake 2 is extremly good. With Space Impact coming a close second. There is a stopwatch, calculator and you even have Xpress covers.I got my phone through Vodafone on pay as you talk, cost around    99:99. But on contrct they cost around    9:99. I strongly advise getting this phone, as you can see it has a wide variety of excellent features.     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::5001299:4:::23544:4:::4451:4:::7813:4:::7813:4:::13861:4:::13861:4:::</endperson>

8970::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::27.04.2001::::    The Nokia 3310 is the natural step up from the 3210. Smaller, lighter and sexier this phone has all the features of the 3210 and a bundle more. Quite simply I dont think I could manage without it. Here s a run down of the featuresPhone Book: Your usual phone number storing, but this time you can store upto 100 numbers. Other new features include send business card, which in other words means you can forward phone numbers to other people. You can also set up voice tags for 8 numbers which means you can just call their name and the number will dial.Messages: The usual text messaging but can send up to 459 characters instead of the usual 200ish. Messages will be split if sent to an older phone. Also more storage for messages and more picture messages.Chat: Waste of time. Wont even bother explaining it as you wont use it.Tones: More than before and space for 8 new ones.Games: Improved version of snake, with better graphics, Bantumi, a puzzle game, Space impact and a new version of pairs.Reminders: Probably the best new feature. You can set an alarm to go off any time in the future with a message of your choice. You need never forget anything againClock: Now includes stopwatch and countdown timerProfiles: Can set up different profiles for when you phones on Silent, Loud etc including being able to make your phone vibrate when it rings mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..........All this with the usual phone features make this an excellent phone to have     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::8741:4:::8132:4:::8132:4:::</endperson>

213::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::13.12.2000::::    I recived my new 3310 as a gift from a freind, at first I wasn t impressed, after all it was slightly heavier than my trusty 3210, however when I put in my sim card (virgin mobile card) I was bowled over. The 3310 makes the 3210 look a bit silly really, its feature packed, has a vibrating battery, screensaver function and loads more.The chat function is Text messaging with a twist,the conversation between you and the person you are texting stays on screen, its like being in a chatroom on the internet.There is even a space invaders type game if you make a mistake the handset shakes  like the 3210 it has a clock but this also has a reminders setting.Although I am using the phone with my virgin card, they are not offering this handset to their customers yet (correct on 13.12.2000) I was just lucky enough to recive the phone unlocked. The Virgin xtra menu does work on this phone. A good budget phone that has good battery life, and features, I wont be replacing my main phone (Nokia 8210) but its great with the pay as you go card as emergency back up.     ::::5311781:1:::5001532:3:::5001674:4:::5001674:4:::</endperson>

21469::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::somewhat helpful::::22.07.2003::::    Nokia phones are one of, if not, the most popular makes of phone on the market. The 3310 is one of their most popular models, which does it make it a bit common.It is a cheap phone, but it serves it s purpose well. The Nokia 3310 is sturdy, easy to use and totally reliable in my opinion. The functions are basic and it does not have internet access, but if you re looking for a cheap phone to text or call from then there s no need to look any further.It s also a very durable phone as many people i know have been known to drop them on several occasions but they are still in working order.Like many mobile phones the covers can be changed and there are loads available for this model, so it can be customised to your own.     ::::6588863:1:::5320274:2:::5186846:2:::5076524:2:::5076524:2:::5364717:2:::5363079:2:::5363079:2:::</endperson>

5020625::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::17.03.2001::::    Now, Nokia must be one of the most popular companies for mobile phones. They are known to be reliable and efficient. The 3310 is the upgrade of the 3210, now known as Nokia s  flagship  handset. I did not have a phone before the 3310, and wanted one badly. So I decided to buy one. I was originally going to buy the 3210, but I did not have enough cash. By the time I had saved enough, the 3310 was available. So I bought it. It is lightweight, easy to use, small, stylish, and has everything you could want from a phone. It has interchangeable front and back fascias, and best of all, no aerial. Enough specs, what is it like to use? Surprisingly easy actually. Mine is on BtCellnet, which is very reliable. From the first charge, it took me about 10 minutes before I was ready to use it  Let s go through the functions of the phone: Phone Book: The main feature of this is to store names and numbers for easy accessibility, with edit, erase and new features. Other than that, you can create  voice tags  which allow you to use voice activated dialling. You can set your speed dials for your favourite numbers, and assign tones so you ll know who s phoning. You can also send business cards containing other peoples, or your own number. Messages: The main use of this is to write SMS text messages, short pieces of text sent from mobile to mobile. You can view your inbox also, containing received messages. Extras for the 3310 include picture messaging, send a picture to a friend to cheer them up, smiley s insert a :-) into your message, and use preset templates such as  busy, call me at home  etc. Chat: This is basically a constant SMS discussion between two phones. Call Register: see the duration of your calls, see who s calls you missed and who s you received, and in some cases, how much it cost. Tones: This part is great. The phone comes with a preset selection of tones, but you can store up to 7 others, which are composed, sent to you by a friend, or off the Internet. There are many popular songs available. You can change the ringing volume as well. Chose the alert you wish to have for a received message, the volume of the keypad tones, and turn warning tones on and off. You can also activate the vibrate alert feature. Avoid embarrassing phone calls  Another 3310 feature is the screen saver. Set it to come on after a certain time of non-use, and a small picture appears on your screen  You can also compose your own tunes, using a wide range of notes. Settings: This is nothing exciting, change your phone and security settings. Call Divert: Used to send calls to your answering service, but you can also redirect all mobile calls to your home phone, when it is not on or you are a t home. Games: Wohoooo  The games for the 3310 have been upgraded. The popular  snake game  has become snake 2, in which the player must direct a constantly lengthening snake towards the food. You can go through walls on Snake 2  There is also space impact, a side scrolling space invaders style game. Take out as many aliens as you can, with your lasers and bonus weapons. There is a boss on each level. There is also  bantumi , which is something to do with pots and beans. Gets me    Finally there is pairs 2, a memory game in which you must remember locations of pictures, and find their pair. You can enable vibration and lights for playing games. Calculator: A handy calculator for on the go calculations, with times, divide, plus, minus and equal functions. Reminders: Never forget that important meeting again. Schedule reminders, with an alarm function, so you ll never forget and important date  Clock: This is more than it sounds. Set the time which appears on the main screen and a daily alarm. But there is also a stopwatch and countdown timer  Profiles: You can put your phone into different modes, or  profiles . With your phone you get things like loud, discreet, general, silent etc. In profiles you can modify, rename or even create new profiles. Chose tones, screen savers and things, and chose a name for your profile. They are accessible through this section, or by pressing your power button once. My Services:* *only available on BT This is a useful BT extra, with the numbers for AA, RAC, talking pages, national directory, the traffic line and more, pre installed. The Xpress on covers are a great extra, as is the ability to change the operator logo. If you get fed up of seeing BT Cellnet, change it  Get a new logo off the Internet from such sites as boltblue.com. I currently have a  cream  logo. This is a great phone, perfect to fit in your hand, and is trendy to show off. A very good handset       ::::5309724:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5020659:4:::17410:4:::17410:4:::7733:4:::</endperson>

5030804::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::05.07.2001::::    About a month ago i bought a 3310 on orange pay as you go.It was    99.I have had about 10 different mobile phones and for the first time i have not been happy with my purchase I (and a few of my friends) have found that the reception does not seam to be as good as even the 3210.  When making a call i often find that when i am connected (there for being charged) I can only hear my own voice. Sometimes it can take a few attempts to get through.  I beleive this to be the 3310 not the orange network, as i know other people having the same problem on other networks.One good thing i bought for this new phone was the orange outhere pack. For    15 you get 5 texts free a day, (which can save you up to 50p a day), free emergency calls for when each voucher runs out, and    5 worth of credit.  This is avalible for any orange phone.I would like to hear from others who have had the same problems with the 3310, to make sure its not just myself and my friends      ::::5055898:2:::17410:2:::17410:2:::5202056:3:::5040619:3:::5000594:3:::5000594:3:::5025866:3:::5025866:3:::5036242:3:::5036242:3:::5026364:3:::5020886:4:::</endperson>

5207774::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::11.04.2002::::    I live quite close the Chessington World of Adventures so it is the obvious place to go if you want to spend all day being spun around on rides, eating fast food and standing in queues.I have been to Chessington many times over the past few years as it is a great day out. Although I have not been to the park with young children, it is definitely the place for them as well. There is a variety of rides ranging from fast and scary to slow and tame for the little ones.The park opens daily during the year from the end of March to the beginning of November. It is closed over the Winter months. If you can it is advisable not to go during school term time or it can get very busy. If that is not possible, either go at the beginning or the end of the season and prepare for a few queues. It is also cheaper to go in off peak time.Depending on when you go, the prices range from    14.50 to    17 for children under 12, and    17 to    21 for 12 years and over. This is quite expensive for a day out, especially if you have a family of four. There are other family tickets that are available ranging from    52 to    63. The entrance fee includes unlimited access to rides and access to all parts of the park. Although food, drinks and souvenirs are all extra.Anyway, now to the fun bit. What is in this park?? Well there are a range of rides that cover most peoples taste. For those of you that enjoy seeing the animals, there is a zoo with Lions, Tigers, Penguins, sealions, and a variety of others. The animal section is quite small so it does not take very long to walk around. There are also different animal shows that you can go and watch during the day.There are fast rides in this park which are the most popular so expect to queue for 1/2 hour to 1 1/2 hours depending on the time you go. Please note some rides do have height restrictions so check them before queuing. The popular ones include:The Samurai - Not for small children. This ride is high and spins around fast  Dragon Falls - Prepare to get wet, good for all the family.Rameses Revenge - Prepare to get very wet. Again not for young children, quite high and spins fast.Vampire - Used to be a roller coaster which was not very fast but good for the first few times. Seems like they have changed it so I will have to go and check it out and let you know.Professor Burps Bubbleworks - This is a great ride aimed at young children but great for adults as well. You sit in a round boat and go through the factory to learn how their fizzy drinks are made. You may get a bit wet but not too bad.Rattle Snake - I must admit I didn t like this ride. It jerks about a lot which is probably how it got its name. It is a slow rollercoaster with a few dips in it.Runaway Train - This is not a particularly popular ride as it is quite slow. However this makes it better for the kids. Not much queuing for this one.Rodeo - This is not one of the top rides but also not one to miss. As long as you haven t just eaten, it is quite enjoyable.Toyland - This has a variety of rides for the younger children. They love it Beanoland - This is quite a new addition to the park and I believe that have just added a new ride. Again mostly for the younger kids. The park is split up into different lands, I have already mentioned two (Toyland and Beanoland). These help provide a bit of fun but also help you to find your way around.There are loads of places to eat although most of them are fast food. There are the usual Burgers, chips and hotdogs but if you look hard you will find something nicer. Food is not too expensive depending on what you want. Other facilities are good. They include: lockers, buggy hire, wheelchair hire, baby facilities, cash points, good toilets etc. I always enjoy it when I go to the park. However it is not very big and if you go a lot then you will get bored with the selection of rides. I will definitely go back when I get a chance to check out the new rides that they have put in. I would recommend to anyone who wants a good fun day out with the kids or whether they are just big kids themselves.      ::::5369254:4:::5096111:4:::5096111:4:::5202792:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::5091531:4:::5202843:4:::5203171:4:::5203171:4:::5202751:4:::5202751:4:::5085331:4:::5202678:4:::10438:4:::5001428:4:::5001428:4:::5066721:4:::5079230:4:::5079230:4:::5186837:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::5093563:4:::5026862:4:::5026862:4:::9435:4:::5066178:4:::5066178:4:::</endperson>

5019316::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::29.03.2001::::    Recently I was faced with the regular question of whether it was worth keeping my old phone and replacing the battery, or upgrading - well there is no choice really is there... A new phone is always better.So I decided it was time to eat my words and fork out    20 for an upgrade to the 3310.And d ya know, it is actually quite good...I have a couple of gripes and there are a few things I like, so here we go The 3310 is essentially a 3210 with a couple of added features, plus it is smaller and the battery alledgedly last longer - I have yet to see the proof of that yet though.So what about the new features?Well I ll start with the best, Voice dialing. You can add 10 (I think) voice tags to your phone, which can be very helpful, especially when you are using the hands free kit.Next, the vibrate alert. This was one thing I missed when I changed from a pager to a mobile before, thankfully it has been included this time You can now save 7 ringtones to your phone.Fully editable profiles are also a bonus. You can select the profiles by pressing the power button, but you can also rename them so they make a little more sense to how you have them set up.The keypad is lockable during a phone call.The reminders are also new and fairly helpful, although they are really just extra alarms.Now, the games have also chaged, which in the case of bantumi and space impact is a good thing, but I really prefer the original snake game, the updates to that seem worth very little.I have used the new chat function once so far, and I don t see the point in it - it is just the same as text messaging anyway, which nicely leads me onto the new longer text messages, sounds like a good idea, but as they are three times as long as the normal text messages, also cost three times as much as a normal text messages.Now, the gripes.Firstly and most annoyingly is the lack of a handsfree profile. With the 3210, whenever you plugged in your handsfree kit, the phone automatically went into the handsfree profile.This was great because you could set different ringing levels etc and not have to bother changing them yourself. On the 3310 you have to change the profiles yourself, even when the handsfree is plugged in.Nokia have messed my menu up All the shortcuts I had learned through everyday use are now useless because they keep putting me in the wrong menus.Another problem with the menus is as there is more than 9 submenus, short cuts like 1-1 will not go to the phone book, but the profile menu instead - quite inconvenient.Its generally the inclusion of poinless things that let this phone down, like for instance the chat function, but if you are just looking for something that lets you keep in touch with your mates, well, its a phone      ::::5026138:2:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5035582:4:::21638:4:::21638:4:::5021043:4:::5018900:4:::20081:4:::2628:4:::5019689:4:::5019689:4:::</endperson>

5066110::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::01.07.2001::::    I bought my 3310 in January at the princely price of    99-00. I chose it over a 3210 for it s size and looks, nothing else.However, I am starting to regret spending so much on a phone, which provides pretty much the same services as the latest, cheaper priced 3210.The only function I really find useful, is the extended text message writing, where you can write upto 3 messages on one screen. This function isn t included on the 3210.The other extras which it has over the 3210 are screensavers, logos and chat, which is a function I rarely use. It enables you to see all the text messages you have sent and received from one person on the same screen. Good, but not necessary and not worth the extra money.Yes, it is a good looking phone and cannot be faulted in layout and ease of use. However, if all you want to use it for, is to send text messages and phone people, the added extras just aren t worth the money.     ::::5002080:2:::5001519:2:::5001519:2:::5020889:3:::5027154:3:::5027154:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::5050930:4:::</endperson>

5055978::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::23.06.2001::::    No sooner have you bought a PC than it is out of date. This  is untrue in consoles. A good console is top of the range for up to 2 years and is not out of date for many many more. The three top companies were nintendo,sony and sega. Sega would always be the first to release the new age consoles these would quickly be out done by nintendo and then sony. No wthe new age consoles are cominbg thick and fast but which to choose.sony s playstation 2 has broken many records and is currently the fastest and most powerful console in the world. its abilty to play all playstation 1 games and uese all playstaion 1 controllers makes it a quite cheap console. as all the periphiles are cheap and affordable. the range of games grows weekly sony reputation has all the main companies developing new gear and games for this powerhouse of a machine.The playstation contains a highly rated DVD player.Nintendos game cube has also been getting alot of press coverage it has been in the works for a long time and has had millions of pounds of research placed into it. to try and improve on the succesful nintendo 64.The 64 was more powerful than the playstation but the quality of games were more or less the same. Many people opted for the playstation as it ws cheaper. the gamecube requires new controllers and memory packs raising the price. and currently it is thought that it does not play 64 games.The press have been focusing mainly on Bill Gates  latest idea the microsoft X box. Microsoft has invested millions into the project and it should be out later this year. Early test suggest that it could be up to 10 times faster than the playstation. it runs not by bit but by MHZ it runs off a 700MHZ processer and uses a direct-x 7 to runt he machine. The worlds biggest companies have all signed up for the x-box it is rumered that sega have givern up and have also begun developing game for the x-box.I would rate the x-box as the best new age console around because of its speed and the reputation it has gainedI would recommend the playstation 2 as the second best because it has been released and has been givern excellent reviews sony are renowned for good consoles and this is no exeption.also because it has been released it has started to drop in price. A drop near christmas is expected.I would rate nintendos game cube as the 3rd best because ony and microsofts systems have been givern better reviews. sony s playstation was once said  quot;half the speed of the 64 twice the quality quot;In Britain the playstation2 is currently 279.00 with a game and a controller with a possible drop to 249.00 before christmas. The X-box is rumered to start between 279.00-299.00 with one game and  a controllerThe game cube is not to releaased for a while in england and no proces have been suggested as of yet.     ::::3897:2:::5202843:4:::5071629:4:::5040699:4:::17308:4:::17308:4:::5003280:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::5050930:4:::</endperson>

5076446::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::25.10.2001::::    Anyway, the review: Nokia 3310 is the big brother of the old 3210, which every one had. It is basically the same phone as all the other Nokia, same set-up etc. It looks quite good and you can change the covers on it, I think this is a good feature as you can make a common phone look personal. Nokia always pull the right stings. Phone Structure A good phone book that is easy to access and look up various names. You can have voice dialling and a vibrating alert when someone calls you. This is a very good feature when you want to be more discrete  Messages are a good feature and the Nokia phone harnesses the power of SMS with it predictive text input system. Very good and super slick menu scrolling The chat function is useless as it costs too much, same as sms to chat but who want to do that, unless you are rich I suppose Tones- you get loads as usual and you can make your own and have different logos on the front of your phone.

5065904::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::28.06.2001::::    I bought my first mobile phone in July 2000. It was a Trium Astral and while it did the job it was not great and didn t do everythin i wanted it to. So in March I invested in a Nokia 3310 and have never looked back since. Everyones happier now - I ve got a new phone and I dont have to keep playin Snake on my Mums 3210 or my Dads 5110. I am very happy with my 3310 and wont have to buy another phone for a while. The new gmes are excellent aswell. The new games, Bantumi and Space Impact, are both brilliant. I use Space Impact just as much if not more then SnakeII. Bantumi is normally used if i feelin a bit more clever but still used alot. PairsII is good aswell though and i play that more than I previously thought I would. The picture messages are also there although I very rarely use them. The layout of the menus is easy to use and familiar to anyone who has ever had a Nokia phone before - if it aint broke dont fix it  Admittedly there is very little between the new 3310 and the 3210 except the new sleeker look, bigger and sharper screen, voice dialling and the vibrate feature. The reason most people want a Nokia phone is the way you can personilise it with ringtones and logos. The 3310 has 7 spaces for new ringtones whether they be composed by you or sent to you by a mate or the net. However, only one logo can be used which I still think is one of only two things that can be improved. The other bein the availability of WAP - but then at 10p a minute this is hardly a huge loss and doesn t ruin the overall quality of the phone - not by a long way.      ::::5309724:2:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::6636:3:::5055829:3:::5020889:3:::19093:3:::19093:3:::16371:4:::5050930:4:::</endperson>

5012998::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::29.01.2001::::    Perosnally, even though this is a compelete upgrade and copy of the last phone, the Nokia 3210, it is an efficient phone and very sexy looking.  Its quite cheap for a new phone and has better games, easier options and is a nice and comfortable phone. It contains new games like Snake 2 and also vibrates which is also good for all you horny people.  (like myslef).  Sorry I ll stick to the subject now.  Anyway this fone is great, I have heard no bad reports bout this phone whereas the new ericcson (T28) i have heard is crap.Its a great phone.     ::::6588863:1:::5003303:1:::5001532:2:::2815:2:::2815:2:::5012982:3:::16725:3:::5002069:3:::</endperson>

18664::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::04.12.2000::::    I was lookin for information on the new nokia 3310 but no1 has written 1. I thought the 3310 was the best new nokia around because it has everything u can possibly think of apart from WAP. It has vibra alert, predictive txt input, voice activator, express on covers, about 45 ring tones, ring tone composer x7, screensavers, multiple txt sending and anything and everything else you can think of. WAP is always crap anyway so no1 would need that, so sum1 give us there opinion about their nokia 3310 b4 i buy 1.     ::::5002080:1:::18872:4:::18872:4:::18976:4:::</endperson>

5017887::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::22.02.2001::::    I felt the new Nokia 3310 was and is a good phone, it is built well and feels robust and neat. The menu system on the phone is easy to use and features like the ability to change the operator logo and ringtones as well as the phones fascias make it easy to personalise. The quality of reception on the phone was high, obviously this has a lot to do with the network on which the phone is used but i felt the speaker clarity was good. The battery life of the phone is also quite long and the charge time is quick, this makes it easy to keep the phone with you at all time and always keep it adequately juiced up. Overall I feel this phone is well finished, affordable and functional, I think it suits most people well and I would highly recommend it.      ::::5016866:3:::5001532:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::20919:3:::20919:3:::</endperson>

5085436::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::02.09.2001::::    I had been the owner of the nokia 402 for about a year and decided that it was time for a change, as there where so many new features coming out on phones these days  So i decided to get a Nokia 3310 as they where light, small and jam packed of usefull features. i had also heard a lot of good feedback on them, which always makes you think about a product more as they are un-biased(ussually)also a number of my friends where proud owners of one and had never expressed any dissapointment over them. **So i got my 3310 which i left to charge for the recommended 16 hours, then when i got up in the morning i was chuffed with what the phone acctually had on it there was so much more than my previus phone:the phone book can hold upto 200 numbers now,there are new games on the phone,there is a new chat feature on the phone there is much more which i will explain further into the opinion. I had got my phone on vodafone because that is the best ntwork in the area i am as most the time i have a full signal alought you have to look into the networks depending on which area you are in (be sure to inquire about the networks in your area before you by) So here are all the options covered on the 3310: Phone Book-This allows you to store upto an impressive 200 numbers,you can assign speed dials in this section,Voice tags which are where you record a name then you say that name and it will dial it if you have the feature tuned on. Messages-This is the section where you write your messages and of course view you recieved messages.The new feature on this phone is the fact that you can now write messages upto 459 words long.in this section you have your inbox/outbox,picture messages,Templates,Smileys,Message settings. Chat-This is a new feature of the nokia phones which i must say i could nt really tell you a lot about it as i never use this feature of the phone  Call Register-This is where you can keep track of missed calls,Recieved Calls,Dialled numbers and all of that stuff which may be of some use to you. Tones-This is the section where you assign tones to your phone there are a large number of pre-made ones however on the 3310 you are able to make upto 7 of you own using the built in tones composer,Also in this section is the screensaver options which i ussually have off as i don t see the point in them as they are nt really needed on mobile phones. Settings-This section of the phone is where you set your phone up and personalise it.You have call settings which features options such as automatic redial,Speed dialing,Call waiting,Own number sending.Then you go onto phone settings which features Language,Call info display,Welcome note,Network selection.Then you have the very usefull security section where you set up your pin codes so if you lose the phone at least it can t be used without a pin code. Call Divert-This is a section where you set up all of the diverts on your phone. Games-This has a selection of 4 new games: Snake2,Space Impact,Bantumi,Pairs2 thses are just for when you are board and want to pass time. Calculater-this is a handy little feature,a calculater which can do all the normal things needed add, subtract,divide,multiply.. Reminders-A new feature which if you are as forgetfull as me this is a very usefull feature where you set the reminders for a date and time and the built in alarm will go off to remind you when ever you set the reminder for. Clock-Then the final feature of the phone, this is where you set the time which is displayed on the main screen you also set the date,also there is a stopwatch and a very usefull alarm clock which trust me does wake you up ** Overall i would have to recommend this phone as it is light and small and packed full of usefull features it is also available on all networks nowadays. Having owned the phone for a couple of months i can now tell you that it has lived upto expectations, and i am very pleased with what i spent my money on. HOPE THIS HELPS YOU **=Main part of opinion     ::::5309724:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5092401:4:::5085430:4:::5012276:4:::5041033:4:::5041033:4:::9435:4:::5020146:4:::5017013:4:::5017013:4:::9444:4:::9444:4:::</endperson>

5000212::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::04.12.2000::::    This phone is staggering.When you look at the featuers it has, it should have a much steeper price tag, but amazingly it retails at just 29.99, and some high street shops are already giving it away free, yes free.This phone is amazing value. It replaces the Nokia 3210 as Nokia cheap and quick to be free phone. However its features defy this price bracket, and make it not just an option for those wanting a free phone, but a real option for those wanting a top of the range model.It comes with all the features of the 3210: text and picture messaging, changable front and rear covers, predictive text, games and more.However the real juicy stuff is the new stuff. Remember this phone is already available free, yet it coems with a vibrate option, a screensaver, customisable background graphics and even voice dialing. And theres more, it comes with a chat feature that lets you chat with friends with the same phone, just like an online chat site.This phone is amazing. It should not be at this price.So why is it at this price, whats wrong with it?Nothing  It comes with the old 3210 interface, which is not the smoothest in the world I admit, but it is fast and efficient.However, the biggest draw back is that it is only available on BT Cellnet and Vodaphone. It is due out on one2one soon, but no release date appears to have been annouced for Orange. We can but hope...     ::::5277861:2:::5277861:2:::5014950:2:::23316:4:::24:4:::</endperson>

5014438::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::05.02.2001::::                                   I have always wanted a Nokia phone, I think it was the thought of                               downloading all those cool tunes into it or changing the covers etc.                                The only thing that really put me off was the price. I was looking for a                               pre-pay phone and the handsets were very expensive. Could I really                               justify    80 to    100 for a Nokia mobile when you could get a perfectly                               good, working phone for    25? Well upto 2 days ago I didnt think                               so...But when I saw the 3310 I fell in love. The handset is small and                               slinky with a lovely curvy design althought it is a little heavy.                                So after handing over    100 of my hard earned cash I retreated to                               quiet area of the shopping centre to play with my new toy without                               looking too sad. To my surprise the battery had a fair amount of                               charge in it, enough to test out the 37 ring tones and the voice                               dialling anyway, As well as the built in ring tones the phone also has                               room for 7 tones you can compose yourself or download from the net.                                You can also change the operator logo for something a little more                               exciting that the  BT Cellnet  one that comes with it, you can even                               have a dooyoo one  cool eh? The only thing I couldn t work out was                               how to get the default one back  After trawling the web I discovered                               that if you send the same logo to your phone again but deliberately                               choose the wrong operator i.e. choose orange if you are with cellnet,                               or vodaphone if you are with one2one etc then save the logo it will                               default back.                                The phone also has 4 games, vibrating battery (which are normally an                               extra), express-on covers, chat room facility, over 400 character sms                               messages, built in ariel and lots more, Which brings me onto the next                               point very nicely. The phone has a built in ariel as I mentioned before                               and a lot of people have told me that the reception would not be as                               good as a phone with a protruding ariel but I have found no loss of                               signal or call qaulity in the short time I have had the phone. The other                               point that comes to mind is how safe the phone is in term of radiation                               emition. The ariel on the 3310 is in the form of a disc located in the                               top of the handset under the  ear piece  which, when using the phone                               is in direct contact with the temple...                                Summing up I would recommend the phone but the price and ariel                               issues are a consideration, It might be worth getting the handset on a                               contract as they are free when doing so but it feels good in the hand                               and just oozes quality.      ::::5014950:1:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5001519:3:::5001519:3:::5014312:3:::5003270:3:::13861:4:::13861:4:::6389:4:::17769:4:::18021:4:::18021:4:::5002576:4:::17253:4:::17253:4:::5003303:4:::23574:4:::23574:4:::23074:4:::4142:4:::4142:4:::</endperson>

5001179::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::06.12.2000::::       The nokia 3310 is a wonderful piece of kit      This phone has some of the best features of the previous best phones but also new and improved features.   The games have been improved with the introduction of Space Invaders     The interface is still Nokia s strongest point, easy, helpful and straight-forward, any nokia is light years ahead of all the other manufactuers in this field.     The composer if effective and fun, allowing many more tuneful ringing tones.        The Chat feature is a small let-down but as more people buy the phone it should pick up again. It really needs to be greatly improved to warrent being there at all.   Best of all, you can still change the covers of course, despite it being a little trickier than the 3210 for example        ::::5309724:2:::23544:2:::29:2:::29:2:::5016866:3:::17253:3:::17253:3:::5001731:4:::</endperson>

5095963::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::02.08.2002::::    After a few useful comments I am providing more information on the benefits of the Nokia 3310. Working for a mobile phone company has given me the benefit of extra information that may not be readily available to the everyday consumer on the high street.BasicsThe 3310 is a basic mobile phone. It doesn t do anything you would consider to be fancy. It has a range of ringtones that vary from Nokia s own theme tune to the Toreador and so on.The buttons are not too small and therefore easy for even those bigger handed people to use.BenefitsI think the main benefit of this phone is the sturdiness. The battery is on the inside of the casing whereas many other phones have their battery as part of the case. With the battery being on the inside of the phone it dos not switch itself off, it can handle being dropped and it still stays on.The phone is small.PriceThe 3310 is available on all networks and can be bought in high street stores at a reasonable    79.99 for Pay and Go when you purchase some talktime vouchers and often for free on monthly payment tariffs.If you are a business user looking to purchase more than one 3310 I would recommend contacting the network directly as they will be able to offer a great dela for tariff and phone together.Battery timeSadly this is the one thing that lets this phone down. The battery life can vary from 1 hour to 4 hours (this is based on talking constantly). It does however only take about an hour to recharge so you can be using it again very quickly.StorageThis phone can hold up to 99 numbers in the sim memory but none on the phone directly. This is an advantage when you come to upgrade as you won t need to retype all the numbers into your new phone.RingtonesThis phone has 35 ring tones, a composer and allows you to send tunes to it from the internet. It will play pretty much anything and actually sound how you hope it will.GamesThere are a few games on this phone but the best one is a card game where you match up pairs of pictures in the fastest time possible.Other featuresClock, calculator and divert options are also available on this phone. I use it as my alarm clock so it even saves you money on buying a new clock radio ScreenThe screen is small but clear and can display the time, the network and other  name tags . The phone book can also be viewed as name only or, name and number.This without a doubt the best phone I have used since my mobile virginity was lost a number of years back.     ::::3343:2:::3343:2:::5186837:2:::6072:2:::6072:2:::6389:2:::5166831:2:::22505:2:::22505:2:::5247678:3:::5247678:3:::5241513:4:::5202843:4:::5014851:4:::5014851:4:::5223826:4:::5202189:4:::5202189:4:::</endperson>

5019416::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::09.03.2001::::    The nokia 3310 is an excellent phone from about    99.99. It is small, cool, lightweight and great fun. There is better featuers on the 3310 then there is on the 3210 including better games: Snake 2, Bantumi, Space impact, and Pairs 2. It is also smaller and lighter than the 3210 and also looks alot better. You can put reminders into your phone so that you wll never miss that dentist appointment and you can choose from 6 profiles. There is a chat feature which allows you to send and recieve text messages in a chat form. You can store up to 7 of your own ringtones as well  It is basically Brill        ::::5076524:2:::5076524:2:::21963:2:::5016911:3:::5016742:3:::5019296:4:::</endperson>

21821::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::19.02.2001::::    The new 3310 is the new range of phones that Nokia is bringing to the consumer and I do think that these do have some good points and some bad points.  The good points are that they have all the new features like vibrating ringer for when you don t want to be annoyed with some annoying ring tone.  Then there are new games that are keeping everyone busy breaking new records and not allowing people to become bored.  However I do feel that the looks of the phone are a little too fat and they don t lend themselves to the sleek fashionable 3210 but they do follow the style of no aerial wish I do like So basically you have to take your pick, have a fat phone that looks and feels a little uncomfortable but you do have the latest hardware on the market   It is basically always down to the consomer and this is you.     ::::5001293:3:::</endperson>

5469307::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::very helpful::::16.03.2004::::    *UPDATE TO GET MORE VIEWERS 25/10/2005*I got my 3310 for my 17th birthday in October 2002 after my Motorola 3788 battery died by getting soaked. After this the battery would never charge again and the phone wouldnt turn on.At that time the phone costs    100 but you can now get it fir about    30 on pay as you goYou can store 90 - 200 numbers on the SIM card depending on the network but you cannot store any numbers on the phone. In the phone book you can add voice dialling to certain numbers and you can assign tones to numbers so you know who is calling before looking at the phone.Messages can be sent either using T9(predictive text) or you can turn it off and send messages the old fashioned way. You can only store about 10 messages in the inbox and outbox, but it depends on the SIM card, and there are also templates that you can use. Picture messages is also stored here.Chat is basically like text messaging except that is is a chat room format and you give yourself a username.Call register allows you to check missed calls, received calls and dialled calls. I think it stores the last 20 on each. You can call these people back. You can alaso check the call timers here and can erase all call lists.Tones is where you can select the default ringer tone. You can choose from a large selecton of 42 tones and 7 of them are for your own composed tones. Message tone can be selected here. There are 5 different tones but one of them is no tone so I would say 4 proper tones. You can also change ringer volume here as well,This menu is good for annoying people in public.(On the general profile set ringer volume to level 5, and set message tone to special. Leave the phone switched on at night on the general profile and hope for a text message at 3am.....It s very loud, and very annoying)And don t say that it can t happen, because it will - it has happened to me numerous times. You will especially receive them from you service provider.Settings is where you can change settings for the phone for example the security settings so you can have a PIN code to be entered when the phone is turned on. You can also set up Call Waiting so the phone alerts you when someone else is caling when you are on the phone.Call divert allows you to divert calls to different numbers for example when you are out ofcoverage, phone is off, or when you dont want to answer. On pay as you go you can only divert to the answerphone.Games - Time for some fun when you re bored. There are four games on the phone. There areSpace Impact - Defender style gameBantumi - Try to get the highest score in your pot (Hard to explain how to play)Pairs 2 - Enough SaidThe best by far is Snake 2 - Guide the snake to eat the food without hitting the walls or the snake. Best phone game ever. My score is 2371 -Beat that  These scores are great for bragging to your mates (especially Snake 2 scores, but you dont see me bragging about my scores).WARNING - if you dont want your battery to die quickly avoid this phone. Snake 2 drains the battery life very quick. Yes its very addictive.Calculator - The calculator is very basic and can only perform the very basic maths calculations (add, subtract, multiply   divide). The calculator may have also had a currency converter, cant remember now, so long since I had itReminders - Set up reminders on your phone when youre busy.Clock - You can set the time a date here, and also set an alarm, and it also comes with a stopwatch and countdown timer.Profiles - Here you can change the ring volume etc of certain profiles. However I only  use general or silent.How easy is it to use?The phone is very easy to use and can use the menu numbers to get to cartain menus quickerHow does the phone look and feel?The phones style is good and is very easy to handle.How strong is the phone?The phone is very strong on the first impact as I found out on 9/3/2004. I received some bad news and my 3310 was in my hand at the time and I literally threw my 3310 across the room and it fell into six pieces. The battery, phone covers, aerial cover and keypad all came off from the main phone part, however the phone works just as well. But dont try it yourselves cause you may not be as lucky. On the second impact, I was not as lucky. In April 2004 it fell off the bench in a swimming pool changing room and the screen shattered, and that was the end of my 3310.How good is the reception?The reception is very good, I always have full reception at home, but as soon as I walk into college the reception goes straight to zero and I get no network coverage. This is because the college has phone blockers.How good is the battery life?The battery says that it takes approximately 2 hours to charge but mine charges in half an hourAprroximate battery life is 4 to 5 days but if youre like me and play snake 2 the battery life will be about 2 to 3 days. It depends on if I leave my phone on or of at nightIs the phone good value for money?The phone is good value for money and you can probably get it like    30 on pay as you go, and free on contract. Is there is a good range of features?There is a good range of features, mentioned above but there could have been more like polyphonic ringtones and WAP but I have no use for WAP.The phone s size and weight is:Height: 113mmWidth: 48mmDepth: 22mmWeight: 133gOverall a good phone, but out of date now, but will be good for a first phone for a child.Sorry this was so longThank you for reading     ::::5473258:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5211882:4:::5211882:4:::5493220:4:::5393945:4:::5000242:4:::5000242:4:::5389951:4:::5389951:4:::5407358:4:::5402732:4:::5393355:4:::5393355:4:::5438380:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::8689:4:::5274315:4:::11996:4:::11996:4:::5261270:4:::5261270:4:::</endperson>

5374085::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::15.08.2003::::    this is a very good phone, it has all of the features you would expect from a Nokia, games, calender, alarm clock, messages, and even rings people  It has been superceded by a lot of models recently but i still find it very trustworthy. i haven t had a problem with it yet but i have noticed the battery is dying on me a little bit. Mine cost me about    100 form dixons but i think they re a lot cheaper now, on e-bay you could probably pick one up for under    30. in conclusion if you are looking for a good, cheap, reliable phone for a young child, or an elderly person who wants to stay in touch then i would reccommend this one lots.     ::::5329277:1:::5240548:2:::5373705:2:::5373705:2:::5373984:2:::5257997:2:::5327084:2:::5327084:2:::5382619:3:::5326218:3:::5326218:3:::5365492:4:::</endperson>

5090959::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::22.12.2001::::    I have been the proud owner of a nokia 3310 since March of this year thanks to losing my last mobile telephone on a train.  Modern technology, especially in the mobile communications industry, moves incredibly quickly.  In this instance I think Nokia have found a winning formula.  It has all the functions I could need on it.  I like to have a large telephone book because I  8217;m forever bumping into old friends and never have a slice of paper and pen to write down their new number.  The text messaging service is especially useful when I can  8217;t muster the energy to speak to someone.  It is also the recognised way of communicating if the friend in question is on a different network, which usually means the call charges become ridiculously expensive.  The call register is useful should you need to copy a telephone number or see how long you have spent speaking to someone.  There is plenty of room for screensavers and tones to be stored.  I find both the reminder function and alarm very useful when I know I need to be alerted for any given reason.  The one function I haven  8217;t activated that I would use from time to time is the Information text service.It is a good size and the weight is perfect.  I have activated both the sound alarm and vibrator.  Quite often I am working in noisy conditions and won  8217;t hear the phone ringing.  The vibrate mode gives enough of a warning that I can feel something move in my trouser pocket.  The handset is neither too bulky nor is it too small.  Also this phone is robust and can easily cope with the odd knock here and there.  I have dropped mine on a number of times and still it works without fail.The two successors to the 3310 are almost exact replicas of the original model.  The upgraded handsets have additional functions, but essentially they are the same telephone.  If I had to advise anyone to buy a new mobile telephone I would highly recommend the nokia 3310.       ::::5311781:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5473258:3:::5202449:3:::5202449:3:::5066721:3:::6072:4:::6072:4:::23074:4:::5078423:4:::5078423:4:::5102019:4:::5001930:4:::5001930:4:::5077595:4:::</endperson>

5019432::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::15.05.2001::::    Being a previous owner of a nokia 3310 i can honestly say there CRAP yes thats right i just called a 3310 crap *Shock* no but seriously i found this phone really crap. First of all the screen s are so easily cracked i had to replace it five whole times yes thats right FIVE god damn times it has stopped working several times and whats the deal with onl;y half the button available for pressing at the top.I know what you will say  it s got a great design and has a range of features  oh look it s got snake 2 brilliant i don t think yes the design of the phone is excellent and they have no aerial which is another added bonus BUT the thing is i m not the kind of person that shell s out    100 for a phone that is easily broken and has a very short battery life.As the successor to a 3210 people would say it s done a great job but not me i had nothing but trouble with it. I now own a motorola v.100 which is an excellent phone and is half the price. It has as many maybe more features than a 3310 and is very strong and doesn t break when you make an accidental drop. On the whole a nice looking phone but not my cup of tea if you know what i mean       ::::5022522:1:::5022522:1:::22150:1:::6072:2:::6072:2:::5078:2:::5078:2:::5035744:3:::5019133:3:::20081:3:::5019065:3:::5001532:3:::2998:3:::5001456:3:::5025695:3:::5025695:3:::5013640:3:::5013640:3:::</endperson>

5019180::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::06.03.2001::::    The nokia 3310.well,where can we start???first of all its looks,smart,small,lightweight and amazingly sexy (For a phone of course )I fell in love with the 3310 the first time i saw it.I thought the 3210 was great but this was even better The aspect i love is that as a text message fan insted of the normal 160 word messages the 3310 has 459 words  But dont think its too good to be true- go over 160 and ur charged for 2 messages,go over 459 and ur charged for 3 The games are great very handy if u travell alot.The ring tones sound good with new ones added that sound great altough a few ring tones are missing.You can store up to 10 of your own cool ring tones either from the internet or made by your self. Theres even a feature that lets you pick a ring tone for each of your friends,so you always know whos calling without looking The phone books pretty basic but as good as a phone book could be.Theres a calculator and a stop watch incase you ever need one,and a cool chat thing that i dont understand and as far as i know nobody else does yet either.This phone is smart yet sexy and will do almost any thing you need from a phone.     ::::4142:3:::4142:3:::22397:3:::5016866:3:::5019279:3:::5012426:3:::</endperson>

5013075::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::30.01.2001::::    Nokia 3310? WOW WOW WOW. I recently bought this phone and am very pleased with it. Its simply fantastic, has all the features you could wish for on a phone. It acts almost as a portable organizer with its  reminders  that you can store, (and send to others to remind them to do something)the numerous phone numbers you can store in your  phone book  and the text messaging which allows you to type messages up to 459 characters long. It is possible to download free ringtones from the internet on it. The phone has logos already stored on it which means you do not have to buy them off the internet for the ridiculous price of    1.50 per logo, but they come free already with the phone. The new model also contains the new  chat  feature, where all the past messages you have sent and received to one person can be saved, enabling you to read the full conversation by scrolling up and down the screen. The phone has  voice tags  which means that you can record a friends name who you regularly phone - then whenever you want to call them you simply say their name into the phone and it automatically dials it for you. The phone contains new games to keep you entertained when you are on the train for example. It can also hold up to 6 profiles which I find very useful as you can change all the settings, according to where you are. For example when you are in town or a noisy restaurant, you might want to have it on the  Loud  profile so that you can hear your phone wherever you are. Whereas, when you are in a meeting, you may like to keep it on  Discreet  so that you are aware someone is calling you as it vibrates, however others are unable to hear it. Really a very good phone with many worthwhile features. I highly recommend it      ::::5012982:2:::5001532:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5012270:4:::</endperson>

5757587::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::31.10.2005::::    Mobile Phones are useful to everyone these days, as they can be used for personal calls and text messaging to people you would like to keep in contact with and for emergences cases, now days you can use your phone in most countries without even the change of a Simcard.NOKIA 3310The Nokia 3310 is an old phone now but it is still a great phone, it s also a strong phone which will last you for years, as long as you don t go over the top and throw it at walls and things lol.The phone is probably one of the easiest phones to use. It does not have many features but it has a few. The phone is ideal for people who don t want to do much with there phones, for example just using it for text messaging and calls. - Network CoverageThe network coverage on this phone is great on the phones behalf, although it could vary depending on the network you have it on.- BatteryThe battery lasts long and it also lasts long when your on the phone for along time, you can get away with forgetin to charge your phone for a day or maybe two..- Making a callMaking a call on this phone could nt be any easier, its so simple, all you do is type the number or search the contact and press the menu button   and your on a call   - Text MessagesSending texts on this phone is easy, once you write and send a full text on it using all the characters available, it will be so simple to send another text on it that you could do it with your eyes closed.You can also send picture messages, but when I mean picture messages on this phone I don t mean the type of pictures you can send the phones these days, the pictures on this phone are just really small black and with pictures made out of tiny black and white pixels that = to a tiny picture.- The Phone BookThe phone book is great, it can store many numbers on it, but this depends on the storage you have available on your simcard.- RingtonesThe phone comes with about 35 built in standard Nokia ringtones which I m sure you ve all heard before, it also has room for 5 of your own personated ringtones, for example you can receive them and you can mess around and create your own tone. :)- Other ApplicationsThe phone has many applications such as games, calendar, calculator, services for going on GPRS or WAP and a few more applications.- The DisadvantagesAs you would no this is an old phone and does not have the features we have on phones these days, such as a Colour screen, Camera, Bluetooth, Video/MP3 playback etc    The phone is also quite big and weighs a bit for a phone, but overall this phone will last you   I would recommend this phone to people who just want a phone for text messaging, calling friends, family or just for emergency cases. The phone is also great to give to children who want a phone because it is a strong phone, and would last them long, as being real top mobile phones these days have got the technology and style but are turning out to be a bit weaker then the older phones.- PriceThe price of this phone these would be really cheap as its old around    15 I would say   but like I said above if its for any of them reasons then its definitely worth it, I would say its more like a barging wouldn t you think?Anyways...Thanks for reading my review I hope you found it useful, thanks.     ::::5341731:3:::5762857:3:::5731104:3:::5739985:3:::5739985:3:::5640881:3:::5640881:3:::5414718:3:::5414718:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5771451:4:::5725162:4:::5660707:4:::5660707:4:::5566929:4:::5566929:4:::5756031:4:::5499641:4:::5763498:4:::5247778:4:::5247778:4:::5768252:4:::</endperson>

4145::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::14.06.2001::::    I find this phone is really user friendly which is its biggest advantage.  It has everything you need plus a few extras and is not very expensive.  The menus are really easy to use and have lots of shortcuts and quick wasy of doing things and the reception is good.  It is also very small.  The vibrating alert is quite useful, not only for using dicretely but if you are in a loud environment.  It also has four games that are quite addictive and will keep you occupied   The battery lasts quite a long time and unlike some phones, doesn t seem to get worse battery time as the battery gets older.  It is also easy to operate one handed.  Overall, it is a pretty good little phone      ::::6239:2:::5035747:2:::5035747:2:::13861:2:::13861:2:::9435:2:::5026195:2:::5027357:2:::5001519:2:::5001519:2:::5050856:4:::5050856:4:::</endperson>

5050895::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::17.06.2001::::    I bought the Nokia 3310 in January because i thought it looked nice and i had read about it s features on the official Nokia web site. It has a chat option, which is handy as you can remember what u said to the other person so what they say makes sence  And you can save them afterwards if you wish, which is nice. Also it has Snake II, Space Invaders and other games which i didn t play much. Snake II is much better than snake I in my opinion, as you can cheat by going through the walls thus getting more points more easily. Space Invaders is another of my faves, tho my friends played it more than i did  Another feature is multiple texting - you can add three texts together and send them all at the same time, this saves alot of time and effort. Like many other Nokia phones you can compose your own ringtones, but the exception with this phone is that you can compose 7 of your own or you can recive them from other phones or from the internet etc. This phone does not come with WAP, but I personally don t like WAP so that doesn t bother me at all. You also have the option of voice dialling, just press down the menu button and speak  The phone  holds 8 voice dials of your choice, along with one touch number dialing, numbers 2 - 9 can be programed to dial any number from your phone book. If you like to look  trendy  or if you like your phone to be cute this is the phone for you. Or if you get bored easily - there are lots of things to play with on the 3310.     ::::5025696:3:::5025989:3:::5040957:3:::5026033:3:::5000696:3:::5035657:3:::15503:3:::5001930:3:::5001930:3:::23074:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::2998:3:::5046041:4:::5046041:4:::2357:4:::</endperson>

5020334::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::18.03.2001::::    I recently purchased this wee baby, I have several mobile phones but this one tops them all, with it s stylish covers and unique features a must for any serious mobilers.  I was  a bit dubious about getting this one as it was so small I thought I would lose it but it actually makes you more carefull where u put it, especially away from the kids.  I like the idea that you can get your own personla logos and and the variety your have to choose from and the vibrating alert is a good feature especially if you are in a private place you can turn off the tunes and just have the vibrating alert on. What really attracted me to this phone was the ring tones aren t the ones you usually get a bit boring, what s good about this one is you can have 7 of your own so if you don t like it you can delete or even put in your own.  There is plenty of websites out there that do freebie ringtones and logo s.  A must to buy for anyone.     ::::5035886:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::5000858:3:::5000858:3:::5019360:3:::5019360:3:::</endperson>

5040864::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::11.06.2001::::    This phone is class. Stylish, easy to use and with a wide range of different stuff. The games are good- I managed to complete snake 2 getting 2480 points. The best thing is being able to compose your own ringtones and have a load imported by text. If you are to get the phone then you have to consider what network to go on. There is allthe talk on what is the best network but really the best network is the network your friends and family are on. You must get this phone. it is probably the best phone out at the moment. i would recommend that you go on the vodafone network, put me on your trust list though.......laterz     ::::5076524:1:::5076524:1:::5040819:1:::5277861:2:::5277861:2:::5018728:2:::</endperson>

5020857::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::20.03.2001::::    This is another great model. Nokia have excelled themselves again with this design.It is a nice size and slips into your pocket quite nicley.This phone is full of features such as:VIBRATION ALERT- this enables you to know when someone is calling you when you dont want a loud ringtone on. SPEED DIALING- this enables you to hold down a number on your keypad and it automatically calls that number for you.VOICE ACTIVATION - if you want to call someone then all you have to do is say there name and it calls them.3 GAMES - The games have been upgraded to snake 2, space invader and another game. These are detailed games and very very addictive to play and to put down.SMS - Normal text messages.CHAT - This enables you to chat with one other phone but is the price of a text message.PREDICTIVE TEXT MESSAGE WRITING - This enables you to have the phone type for you but you still have to write but not so much, you can also have ther option of writing the normal way too.The phone has all the other features such as:composing your own ringtones, and other things like that.This phone is full of features and the price of this phone is about    90 but it depends on what network you want it on.     ::::23574:2:::23574:2:::5001299:2:::5021134:3:::</endperson>

5086087::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::24.08.2001::::    The 3310 goes a long way to correct many things i found wrong with my 3210. Its smaller lighter and easier to use. It has more games more options, longer battery life and longer talk time. The range of options makes most of the difference as to me smaller mobiles dont really make much difference, they are just more likely to be lost. Nokia though have still not removed the annying feature of predictive texting though it is as with the 3210 easy to turn off. On BT my network provider i can now store more numbers too but this is reliant on the sim card so cant realyl be included in the review. Nokia have retained the abilty to change colours that helps you make your phone individual. Ok then here goes My attempt to add more detail after the complaints i recieved. You can still compose your own ring tones and still have the ability to transfer ones from your PC to phone using a link cable. I find the new games better than the ones avialable on the 3210 though they are once again not highly exciting. Snake 2 is not much of an improvment on its stablmate, though the space game is quite good for something you get free with the phone. Nokia though have seriously tried to pull out the stops to make this phone better in every department than its competitors and its predecessors to try and curb their share of the market. You also get more space for ringtones with the ability to store 7 of your own a vast increase on the 3210.     ::::5085331:2:::5027357:3:::5077810:3:::5085594:3:::20164:3:::5065833:3:::3447:3:::</endperson>

5026722::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::07.05.2001::::    I have only owned two mobiles, and recently upgraded from a 3210 to a 3310, both on the Orange network.  Firstly the 3310 contains more features as you would expect from a newer phone but its enhancements go beyond just the next model.  One of the things I was dissapointed about with the 3210 was it always seemed too quiet, even on  Loud .  The 3310 seems much louder and has a vibrating alert - big advantage.  Also the 3310 can hold much more picture messages and up to 7 of your own ringtones each of which can be accessed in  Composer .  Also the ability to create your own profile allows you to completely personalise the phone.  The 3210 is slightly taller, but thinner than the 3310, and noticeably heavier.  The build quality of the 3310 doesn t quite seem as robust as that of the 3210, but still is adequate.  Slightly different games and a  Chat  service, as well as the voice activated dialling also separate it from the 3210.     ::::5055913:3:::5026309:3:::6072:3:::6072:3:::5013640:3:::5013640:3:::</endperson>

T-D1 Special: One can let here news via sport, stocks send ... to themselves.The display is 2,4 cm high and 3,3 cm broad and therefore too quite large. the accumulator of the Handys hear very long ones (up to 5 days, if one slightly telephoned) and one charges fast  The Handy also control a LOGO storerooms, that again is extinguished, if one the nearest stores. one keep up the 3310 in the case of a SMS not only 160 signs writings but 460 signs. if one a long SMS to a person addresses it also has that Nokia 3310, costs the SMS just as much as a short SMS. if one however to a person with another Handy addresses, arrive several of these small SMS and then also cost as two or three,  how long the NAUTICAL MILE.One already sees clearly in the case of these many functions that Nokia 3310 already to the better Handys on this price class learned. Nokia 3310 is genuinely to be recommended und already for 250,- DM to have     ::::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5191946:4:::5092401:4:::</endperson>

5016607::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::16.02.2001::::    I recently accquired a Nokia 3310 and I think it is stylish, light weight and small enough to fit into my breast pocket. I particulary like the ease in which you can flick through the menus by using the numbers instead of scrolling right the way through. The games are great and don t seem to use up match of the battery, which is a great for me because I can t seem to put the thing down. It s also a good feature that if someone rings you whilst your playing it doesn t interupt the game other the ring tone of course.I use mostly use my mobile for text messaging, and the Nokia 3310 is great for this with predefined useful messages and a dictionary function, although the dictionary can be quite annoying at times so I switch it off.So in summary I would highly reccomend the Nokia 3310 to anyone who likes to play games on their mobile and wants a nice small stylish easy to use mobile.     ::::5003492:3:::5003492:3:::21963:3:::5001743:3:::</endperson>

13607::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::15.07.2001::::    With its sleek design, 3 games and the option of customising ringtones and logo  8217;s, you might think that the hugely popular Nokia 3310e is just a fashion accessory. This is true, it is a fashionable phone, but it also boasts a wealth of practical features. The voice activated dialling is one of my favourites. Sometimes you are in a hurry and don  8217;t want to work your way through the phone book entries, so all you have to do is assign a   8216;voice tag  8217; to your most frequently used numbers. Hey Presto  You can then dial them up just by holding down the   8216;Menu  8217; key and saying their name. The   8216;Vibrating Alert  8217; feature is also very useful. It gives you peace of mind that you  8217;ll be aware of any incoming calls when it isn  8217;t appropriate to have your phones sound turned on. Also, unlike some earlier models, the 3310 key lock means that emergency numbers such as 999 can  8217;t be accidentally dialled whilst in the bottom of your handbag etc. The phones memory offers space for 90 phone numbers in the phone book. There are a number of different ways of presenting your names and numbers. You can also assign different ringtones for different callers. So, for example, if you have a friend who loves the x-files you could set it up so the theme tune plays when they call you   8211; you  8217;ll instantly know who s calling. :>)Sending text messages is ultra-quick and ultra-simple on the Nokia 3310e. You can send up to 459 characters at once   8211; that  8217;s 3 full messages. The phone also has an inbuilt dictionary feature that attempts to successfully finish off words for you. You  8217;ll either love this or hate it  8230;but don  8217;t worry its easily turned off. The phone also offers 4 games. Snake 2   8211; the sequel to   8216;Snake  8217; is a simple but annoyingly addictive little game, where you get your snake to eat as much food as possible  But beware, when the snake eats, he gets longer. and if you run into the snakes tail you lose the game  In my opinion, snake 2 is better than the first version, as you can put it on the   8216;no maze  8217; setting, so you don  8217;t have to worry about crashing into the walls. The other 3 games are Pairs, a concentration type card game, Space Impact, like the arcade classic asteroids but with cool sound effects, and Bantumi. I  8217;m afraid I never got the hang of Bantumi, and can  8217;t tell you much about it  The phone is a good investment; with all the customisation opportunities such as logos ringtones and covers (around    10-   24) the phone has a long shelf life. Unfortunately, the price of pre-pay Nokia 3310e  8217;s has risen quite dramatically, but I really do recommend this phone to you.     ::::5311781:2:::5301118:3:::5277861:4:::5277861:4:::5202843:4:::23227:4:::5003280:4:::9435:4:::5026703:4:::20081:4:::5017028:4:::5017028:4:::5027154:4:::5027154:4:::5021406:4:::5021406:4:::5020889:4:::5035866:4:::</endperson>

5021254::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::27.03.2001::::    Nokia s latest addition to their range, the 3310, may not be as tiny as the 8210, but its impressive messaging capabilities, along with an appealing features set, make the 3310 a communication powerhouse. Measuring 113 x 48 x 28mm (HWD) and weighing just 133 grams with the battery, it is certainly not a burden on the pocket. According to Nokia, the rechargeable NiMH battery gives up to four and a half hours of talk time and approximately 260 hours of standby time, and we found nothing to disprove this fact. What really makes this phone a standout are its messaging capabilities. Similar to an online chat, the Mobile Chat feature allows you to chat via SMS to multiple friends simultaneously, you can even give yourself a nickname. The 3310 can also send a single message to several people at once, just like sending an e-mail to a group. And to make messaging just a little easier, you can save messages as templates if the message is something you send frequently. The 3310 also has thirteen picture messages, but you can download more from the Web. This also can be done with the 3310 s screensavers. These display whilst the phone is in Standby mode, and include Rock  n  Roll dancers and coffee cups. Other impressive features of this phone include Voice Dialing, message dictionary, vibrating ring tones, a currency converter, four games, and interchangeable  Express-on  covers. The full kit includes the phone, battery and a charger. Spare batteries and car kits are available separately. The 3310 is available now from most mobile phone outlets.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::3680:4:::3680:4:::</endperson>

5030742::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::05.06.2001::::    This phone is mainly aimed at youths in fact it  8217;s probably the standard issue youth phone, which every youth has. The phone is quite small and compact. It has all of the nokia features on it address book, calendar, clock etc etc. The games included on the phone are space impact, snake 2, and some other little odd game. Snake2 and space impact are enough to keep any phone game junkie happy. There is also to other great features on the phone. One is the ability to link 3 text messages together to make one long one, and this never seen before feature called chat. Basically this allows the user to monitor a  text chat  it allows you to see how many messages you ve sent to one person and what they  8217;ve sent back all on one screen (well you have to scroll down of course.) I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone and wants a good reliable phone, If you are wanting the best and most stylish phone on the market then don  8217;t go for this. There is of course its newer model the 3330 which comes with WAP (which isn  8217;t worth having its 2 years premature) This is a good phone.      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::3447:3:::5019065:3:::5035850:4:::5035994:4:::5035994:4:::</endperson>

8601::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::somewhat helpful::::06.02.2001::::    this is a brillaint mobile phone. Nokia have looked at all their existing products and improved on them by bringing out this fone. First of all it is the perfect size and the keys are not too small either. It is so much better looking than the 3210 and everything has been improved on from battery time is longer, stand by time increased, charges up quicker, predictive text input for quicker composing of text messages and vibrating alert. Its just a fantastic phone. So many features too many to mention.     ::::5373984:1:::5001205:1:::5001205:1:::5277861:2:::5277861:2:::</endperson>

5027427::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::16.05.2001::::    The Nokia 3310e is a sleek, small, light and stylish. It comes first off; with an attractive grey case; with a small version of the  Orange  symbol on the front, and cute little silver keys. It is a phone that can only be described, much to the dismay of all men who own in... as cute. Its small, compact and attractive, without being so small you cant press the buttons Being a Nokia, the menus are so easy to work... even for me, a total techno-phobe  There is the usual Nokia games, but with a new and improved  Snake 2  and  Space Impact  and many others that i have never got round to playing properly  Then it has the usual Calculator, Clock and message services. But with a lot of added features such as  Profiles  which enables you to change the ringing volumes, types, message beeps etc and then rename them etc. It  8217;s a good way to personalise your phone and make it ring and beep for messages just how you want it to  It also has a  Reminders  system, where you can set your phone to ring an alarm, to remind you to do something, at many different times of the day.In the messages section, there is a  templates  option, for the lazy among us, with pre-written sentences, where you can fill in the blanks to send a quick msg... Never actually used it... by the time you have filled it all in, you could have written your own msg   There is also  smileys  where you can add pre-created cute little smiley faces to your msg... It  8217;s so easy  There is also a  Chat  service on the 3310e. To be totally honest and unhelpful, I have no idea what it does... apart from the fact you can send messages back and forth to someone, but only to other 3310e s... surely its rather like the regular text msg s just more restrictive...?  All in all, a totally wicked phone. I have even dropped mine three times, and it still works without fault...

5171866::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::22.12.2001::::    Nokia 3310The nokia 3310 is a bit of an old model now and its upgrade has come out the 3330, but the 3310 is still a very good phone. Its looks good sounds good and makes you look good.  I was going to buy the 3330 but for    30 more I didn  8217;t see the point, it was just a waste of money so I got this one.The things I like about this phone is the ring tone from trigger happy tv, which when ever it goes off some one always shouts hello   Its also light and you can change the cover, its not like that brick the 9210 Even tough it has a palm top build in whose pocket could that fit in to? or the 8210 its so small that if you do put it in your pocket you wont find it for a weak or two.Its also the first nokia to loss the stubby aerial which always poked you in the side when its in you blazer pocket.The buttons are also just the right size to play snake with and get a good score, unlike the 8210 where the buttons are so small that you have to have nails to get to the buttons, and with such a small phone you put it to your ear to hear the person your talking to but you cant speak back because the receiver only reaches you nose  While with the 3310 its just right to speak into.I think this is still one of best phones on the market with a vibrate function, the time built in and games.

5652666::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::18.06.2005::::    The Nokia 3310 was one of the most common phone around. To those looking to buy a phone on the cheap, I d be surprised if anyone did not recommend this phone.Now I don t know the innards of this phone - so don t expect me to give you exceptional details - instead I will give the features and what you can expect from this phone.EASE OF USE:This phone is incredibly easy to use. To those people who are not technology wizards, you will find this phone easy to use. The instructions in the manual are very clear, and it only requires an average of 3 buttons to get to any specific place on the phone. Previous Nokia users will also find this a doddle because the interface as always is the same.LOOK AND FEEL:The interchangable covers allow this phone to be moderated any way you like. These cost various amounts - normally about    5-   20. This phone brand is exceptionally common, so you cannot expect to be laughed at because your phone is bad. The covers can even have a photo you have sent into a certain company.The phone is a little chunky and heavy compared to newer phones but there is no problem with that - I personally want to be able to press the buttons properly without having to press three letters at a time (What I am getting at is the fact that the keypad buttons are nicely spread apart.DURABILITY:The phone is very robust. You can obviously get it insured in case, but apparently phones nowadays have to be able to withstand a 3m drop on concrete. The covers can slip off however, and if you do drop the phone, the covers can become loose.RECEPTION QUALITY:I am a previous owner of 2 other phones, and I have found this one to be the best - of course Nokia are probably the most sought after company in the mobile industry, so anyone can expect this quality in all their phones.GAMES:There are 4 games to chew over, Snake II, Pairs II, Bantumi, and Space Impact. Everyone knows Snake, and Pairs is like memory where you have to uncover the pairs which are the same from a collection of cards. Space Impact is a little like Space Invaders - where you have to shoot space thingies, and not be shot at or hit a rock. Bantumi is a complex game which is not well explained in the phone, and it takes time to figure out the rules to it.There are too many features for me to mention. It holds roughly 20 texts, 100 phone numbers (I think, for me it wass 200, but that might have been just on Virgin)The battery life isn t brilliant - the phone lasts surprisingly short, and if you are playing games, having sounds turned on, vibration on, and lights on, the battery life will run down. But remember to charge that baby for 18 hours first   Buy this phone if you can, it is a gem, and you will be happy with it. But with the newer models coming out, I wouldn t be surprised if this phone lasts in the shops much longer.     ::::5258003:3:::5258003:3:::5623795:3:::5512183:3:::5633146:3:::5217966:3:::5217966:3:::5631860:3:::5631860:3:::5645474:3:::5647941:3:::5386276:3:::5386276:3:::5615340:3:::5615340:3:::5585858:3:::5585858:3:::5203100:3:::5013640:3:::5013640:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5078423:3:::5078423:3:::5600891:3:::5656780:4:::5656780:4:::5643371:4:::5643371:4:::5393550:4:::5652350:4:::5664247:4:::</endperson>

5429559::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::30::::helpful::::15.01.2004::::    More people in the world have owned a Nokia 3310 than have ever owned any other model of phone, and with product ranges now diverging and diversifying, it is highly likely that this will go down as the most popular, most produced handset in history.Between 2000 and 2003, the 3310 and its international derivative models were offered as a low-cost model by pretty much all networks in all countries. This was a time when uptake was high, and, when first launched, the lack of an aerial and small factor made it instantly popular.If you want the latest (or indeed the three years old) technology then this is not a phone for now. Today it looks and feels dated, and the features and memory are limited. The phone features a four colour greyscale display, SMS messaging (contacenated for longer messages), voice-activated dialling, and a limited address book. Other basic features are included, like mono beep ringtones, a fairly non-intuitive ringtone composer, built-in games and a clock/alarm.In particular the  Bantumi  game was one of my favourites, and hardly appeared on any other handsets, while the front and rear covers are changeable, and because this phone is so very popular, there are thousands of facias available, of both the official nokia variety and those to be found unofficially on market stalls.These days we expect more. WAP connectivity, colour displays, flexible storage, downloadable games and applications, and a wealth of other tricks in the box. The 3310 does not deliver this, nor is it supposed to.In 2004, I would expect a model such as the 6100 to inherit the mantle of  standard entry-level Nokia handset , which means that the last 3310s on the market are now stupidly cheap.I finally replaced mine in 2003, after a couple of years of good service. By today s standards it s nothing special, but it can still do a job, and do it well. Second hand models sell for next to nothing, and networks are almost giving them away on  pay as you go  deals.     ::::5469307:3:::5399756:3:::5433219:3:::5373984:3:::5208225:3:::5208225:3:::5019689:3:::5019689:3:::5250545:3:::5250545:3:::5203171:3:::5203171:3:::5330317:3:::5330317:3:::5326218:3:::5326218:3:::</endperson>

5398137::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::28.10.2003::::    ok, i bought this phone just over 3 years ago (july    01) and i am still using it today (granted i am now looking to get a new phone). however, i have had only one problem with this phone that being the battery stopped working. even so, that was due to my carelessness in frequently charging and never letting the battery fully run down (be warned all mobile users) compared to the mobiles of 2004, this phone is extremely dated, it really has only the basic functions, text messaging, reminders, phone book, calculator, stopwatch   . let me explain. the menu goes like so: 1: phone book. this really speaks for itself with it generally holding 100 numbers (although with o2 this is extended to 150) within this menu you can assign ring tones to a maximum of ten callers; send numbers in the form of a    business card    (although only to other nokias); alter the presentation of the numbers    2: messages again this is reasonably self-explanatory. the    write message    section enables you to write a message as long as 349 characters however for every 160 characters you are charged for one message but it does mean you don   t have to send the first part before finishing writing. the inbox and outbox combined can contain from 10 to 20 texts again dependent on your network. there   s also a template menu and smiley menu for easily inserting them into texts as you write them. a handy function if you need to send a certain message frequently however i do not. 3: chat i   ve never fully grasped how this function really works but it   s meant to work in a way that presents texts sent between two people as though in a chat room so the messages both sent and received can be read. 4: call register again a pretty standard function containing a record of the last 20 dialled, missed and received calls and also measures the length of the last call made and total calls made which is handy with a free minute limit. 5: tones With this phone you get 30 monophonic ring tones with 7 spaces for manually composed tones. 6: Settings Again this is very standard and not very interesting. 7: Call Divert I did say this phone was basic. Again a dull and standard section but handy. 8: Games Where would a vintage nokia be without snakes, snakes 2 ? The games consist of snakes 2, bantumi (an interesting but slightly confusing version of an African board game), space impact (a take on space invaders) and Pairs 2 (pairs basically; a simple game but if you   re fingers are hurting from snakes or space impact   ) 9: Calculator 10: Reminders 11: Clock Three basic menu functions that do as they say really. The clock menu includes an alarm (with snooze), a stopwatch and countdown timer. 12: Profiles A now standard function but in its heyday was unique. Programmable profiles to suit your life. And so I declare that this is definitely an excellent phone model. Granted few people will now be wanting to buy such a dated model-alas it features no colour screen, nor integrated camera, nor polyphonic ring tones. However the fact that it retails at    80 as new and I bought it for    100 3 years ago makes quite clear its value and durability. I have dropped this phone (and still am) frequently resulting in parts flying everywhere but it lives on. When it comes to phones, I   d go Nokia all the way   They   re almost always the most attractive, always user friendly and do their job well. The only reason I wouldn t buy this phone again is because I want to go for more of a looker this time: fashion over function im afraid :) I ve only selected poor reception due to o2 failing in areas I frquent: Friends with the same phone have had no problems on other networks.      ::::5617609:3:::5617609:3:::5365437:3:::5365437:3:::5277178:3:::5331212:3:::5344342:3:::5344342:3:::5255253:3:::5320274:3:::5314452:3:::5314452:3:::5240190:3:::5392677:3:::5392677:3:::5370041:3:::5281759:3:::5281759:3:::5337786:3:::5076524:3:::5076524:3:::5305309:3:::5208058:3:::5078423:3:::5078423:3:::5013036:3:::5013036:3:::5331903:3:::5373984:3:::5326218:3:::5326218:3:::5697497:4:::5697497:4:::5386276:4:::5386276:4:::5077639:4:::5077639:4:::</endperson>

5012982::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::20::::helpful::::29.01.2001::::    The 3310, a better phone than before?I think NOT.The 3310 is a wider, taller and fatter phone than the 8210 ans the same width as a 5110 (an older phone) with a slim battery.A lot of people have bought this phonebecause it is a newer phone with newer functions? Well, the phone remains the same with only 2 major differences between the 3210 (also an older phone). These changes being a  chat  and the new selection of games including  space invaders .Chat - is a joke in itself it costs LOTS of money for a fucntion which crashes every second. Basically u send txts to each other. WOW.The new selection of games is mearly to impress the childern as normal which only increases sales. The games themselves are poor and a waste of battery.Another MAJOR problem which now seems to be occuring is the continues problem of reception as now NONE of the new batch of models are getting any recption anywhere, or in very few places.The 3310 is a supposedly better phone than the 8210. It was released in time for the cristmas sales to promote sales of the product itself. The 8210 was release prior to this with no signifact launch apart from Charlie s Angles. (even thought the phone had been out for a while before the release of this film.)The 8210 which u can now get for free from various retailers is obviously a better phone. i would recommend it over this  Childs Phone  to anyone who wants to look stylish.3310 - A Childs Play Thing.     ::::5013043:1:::7254:2:::7254:2:::5012998:2:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5012156:3:::5012156:3:::23227:3:::</endperson>

5012361::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::28.01.2001::::    I have been asked to test this phone by many of my friends, and I can tell you that it is an excellent phone for a present to a child or a teenager as it has fun features and looks great.Body.Sticking to its great idea of changable faces this phone has got the frot and the back to look new and personal, the shape is in between the 8210 and the 3210. Its a nice weight and quite robust.Software.Better than the 3210 but its not what I would call a serious phone. It has some great features like space invader and it is definitly a play ground attraction but for a serious phone I would recoment the 6210 or the 8210. The software is more reliable than the 3210 as this phone so far hs not crashed or lost memory. There is now a chat function that does not serve any real purpose and a linked text function.Display.Good and clear, nice graphic and as usual Nokia have kept their high valued phone friendly approach, which is that the phone is very easy to use with good short cuts and easy to use memory.I would say that the non arial approach that nokai is now taking is a good one as the shape is nice and small but not too small to lose. There are a lot of good things about it but as I said it is not a seriouse phone but a great present if you want to buy either your kids or their friends a mobile for there birthday. It is also available on pay as you go with BT cell net which is a good buy if you dont want you kids destoying your bank account with OUTRAGEOUS phone bills.Yours OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS     ::::2998:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::5002171:3:::15714:3:::4665:3:::11829:3:::11829:3:::5012892:3:::5012892:3:::5012156:3:::5012156:3:::5000696:3:::3369:4:::5002639:4:::</endperson>

5015381::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::very helpful::::11.02.2001::::    Having received the Nokia 3310 for Christmas on the Orange JustTalk package, I have had just over one month to fall in love with a sublime, elegant phone. The convenient menu system allows easy access to the many functions, including the wonderful game, Snake II, an evolution of Nokia s very successful  Snake  -- featured on many phones, among others, the popular 5110 and 3210. The battery life, particularly on such a graphics-oriented mobile, is excellent, and I have found it unnecessary to re-charge my phone more than twice a week; of course, the more you chat or text, the more you charge it, but even talk-time life isn t too bad, with between three and four hours commonplace. I asked specifically for this phone, having had personal recommendations from, among others, my girlfriend s mother, grandparents and several friends. I think the list just given, actually, covers the  Who should buy?  section (having just glanced to the top of the page ); the phone is suitable for pretty much everybody. The graphic menu makes it easy to use for everyone, and it s very easily navigable, with the centralized menu key. The ability to send multiple text messages at once, although useful, is possibly the phone s only negative feature, insofar as I found it to slow down as the message went beyond the first message. Picture messaging, though, although a little more expensive, is fun, but, at present, limited. An improvement over the phone s predecessor s option of 3 pictures is, however, given. This phone, really, is perfect for those seeking an upgrade to their 5110 or 3210. There is more space for downloaded ringtones, and a wonderful (if irritating for others ) Composer tool. Predictive text input I found limiting, largely because I write in French and German as well as in English, and therefore the English dictionary is unhelpful, For most people, though, it is a useful tool Generally, this phone is perfect for anyone, although it s bit pricy at    100. It does, however, have enough about it to make it well worth the money.     ::::10307:2:::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::23574:3:::23574:3:::5001532:3:::5217258:4:::5217258:4:::5015377:4:::5012426:4:::17253:4:::17253:4:::23158:4:::5012148:4:::5012148:4:::18451:4:::286:4:::7254:4:::7254:4:::9435:4:::5002378:4:::5002378:4:::13861:4:::13861:4:::4881:4:::</endperson>

5000892::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::12.12.2000::::    I got this phone for    29.99 on a vodafone special deal a couple of months ago and have overall been pleased with it.The phone is small and stylish and fits perfectly in the hand but still has the functionality of a larger phone.  It has a number of useful features and some really good games although there is a small problem with text messaging.  On a normal phone you get around 160 characters per text message, on the 3310 you get around 400.  What you don t realise is that you pay for one text message PER 160 characters.  There is no warning of this so it could end up costing a fortune   It is very easy to text on this phone as it has nice large, raised keys as opposed to the tiny little keys on such models as the 8210.I have had a couple of problems with the phone that other 3310 users have also mentioned and that is that the phone occasionally freezes when sending a text message and you have to take the battery off to get it working again.  I think this may be a fault with the earlier built models.The phone is also extremely hard wearing, being a slightly clumsy person i have dropped the phone several times and still not managed to break it.  Therefore a good phone for all you clumsies out there.Overall i would recommend this phone.     ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::5001205:3:::5001205:3:::11325:4:::11325:4:::5001353:4:::16949:4:::16949:4:::</endperson>

5021534::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::29.03.2001::::    After owning a Nokia 3210 for a year, I recently switched tariffs to Genie (see my opinion for information), and with it, switched to the newer 3310. At first glance, nothing seems to be special. Covers still clip on and off, it s still got profiles and the best games, but just go through the menus, and it all becomes better and better  There s business cards to save you having to recite your number every time someone wants it. There are smiley :-) templates for quick sms. There s even a mini chat-room, and that really is something  Just like a normal chat room, but on your phone  I haven t tried it between more than two people (is that possible?) but between two it s great, because you don t have to keep flicking back through past texts to see what the conversation is about  7 (count them: SEVEN ) composable ring-tones, plus about 40 pre-composed ones mean you can really personalize your phone, and there are even cutesy little screensavers you can put on  Reminders give you a little buzz when it s time to ring someone, or to remind you to call back that certain someone, and call diverts for when you don t want to speak to a certain OTHER someone  The menu system, as with all Nokias, is easy to use, and the Navi-button handles all the menus, along with the two scroll buttons and the Clear button. It s as simple as that  Add to that a long battery life, clear reception with a good signal, and the fact that it s survived the many times that I have dropped it, and all-in-all, you have a great package, and a worthwhile investment for anyone      ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::4142:3:::4142:3:::5017514:3:::18976:3:::3715:3:::10438:3:::5019689:3:::5019689:3:::5021494:4:::5012269:4:::5012269:4:::</endperson>

5021187::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::40::::helpful::::23.03.2001::::    I bought this phone just as it came out sometime last year, i think that it was well worth the money. Mine was    99.99 on orange network. It has many features such as voice activated dialling, which actually works  chat option in which you can write longer text essages to people who have the same phone. It also has ring one composer which allows you upto 7 extra ringtones. You can also get a logo for on the screen. I just bought an excellent flashing clip on cover for my phone from Argos at only    14.99     ::::5018900:2:::5017514:2:::5021554:4:::</endperson>

5012275::::Nokia 3310::::Telecommunications::::50::::helpful::::26.01.2001::::    What phone in the same price range is better.....none. This phone has everything its slim, easy to use and beat of all it looks great. The X-press on covers mean you can personalise the phone to your hearts content and this is helped by the compose your own ring tune function, superb.But the phone is not just good to look at it weighs just 133gramms which may not be the lightest of phones but at least you ll know its in your pocket which may be reassuring during those I can t feel where my phone is moments.The phone extends the amount of games from the hugely addictive Snake to Space Impact which is a Space invaders style games which includes vibrations if you so wish. The built in vibrator makes it the perfect phone for work or schools when nobody but you should know you   ve got a call. The standby time of the battery of up to 260hours is pretty impressive coupled with up to 4/5 hours of talktime give the phone excellent stats.The thing that really makes the phone is that it is affordable and has everything you need, it may not be as light as the 8210, but who has    200 to fork out, not me for a phone. So being able to get this phone free with a contact makes it the best available.       ::::5277861:3:::5277861:3:::13861:3:::13861:3:::5012156:3:::5012156:3:::5013203:4:::5013009:4:::5012658:4:::</endperson>
